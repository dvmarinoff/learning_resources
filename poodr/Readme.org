* Description

Notes, reflections and code examples from the book Practical Object-Oriented
Design with Ruby.

For this book I choose a code format instead of org hoping the book will be
more code heavy. The main file is poodr.rb. The .js and .rkt try to follow
with the examples written in classless javascript style (Crockford) and
Racket.

It is actually the best book I have ever read on Object-Oriented Design.
Much better in communicating the concepts than Uncle Bobs books.
The choice of Ruby is perfect. This way the auther can examine a wider
range of OO concepts, and the knowledge translates with ease to any other
OO language.
