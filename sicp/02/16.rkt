;; interval arithmetic devise a better package

;; Explain, in general, why equivalent algebraic expressions may
;; lead to different answers. Can you devise an
;; interval-arithmetic package that does not have this
;; shortcoming, or is this task impossible? (Warning: This
;; problem is very difficult.)

;; seems to be bound by some fundamential computer science/
;; mathemathics problem, like undicidability or something
;; I'll expore it at later times since it is more of a math
;; theory related problem.
