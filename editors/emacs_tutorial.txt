Manual installation

in ~/.emacs.d
at ~/.emacs.d/init.el add

(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)
	     (package-initialize)

M-x package-refresh-contents

M-x package install [RET] cider
M-x cider-jack-in
M-x cider-quit

;; Easy Clojure setup

     - just delete any .emacs or .emacs.d and in fresh .emacs.d
     paste the content of the zip. In init.el paste the lines
     from README.md instructions for cider upgrade and run emacs
     - has very outdated packages, so better base a new config on it
