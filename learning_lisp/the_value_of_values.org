Summary:

Rich Hickey compares value-oriented programming with
place-oriented programming concluding that the time of
imperative languages has passed and it is the time of
functional programming.

I.T. stands for information technology,
Keeping in mind what Infrormation means is important.

Information

Inform
    - to convey knowedge via facts
    - give shape to (the mind)

Information
    - the facts

What is a fact?

The key word which is going to be a key is Fact or Facts.
We are going to give more precise meaninig to that,
and we are going to see if our information technology
actully manipulates information.

Wrong definition:

Fact is a place where information is stored
There is a place for every piece of information
Facts have a set of operations, e.g. get and set
Operations control how facts change
To convey fact, convey its location

Place

A particular portion of space
An area used for a particular purpose
Memory Adress, disk sector

Information Systems

In memory
    mutable objects are abstractions of places
    objects have methods

In durable storage
    tables/documents/records are places
    DBs have update

Objects are baricates infront of memory, so we dont
have to manipulate directly memory addresses
Same for the DB abstractions
Main evidence for this Place-Oriented abstraction
is the Update

PLOP

Place-Oriented Programming
New information replaces old
Born of limitations of early computers
    small RAM and disk
Those limitations are long gone



The Efficiency of Place

it will have a use, but when it is appropriate?
I.T not T.T.

Memory and Records

Mental memory is associative and open
Real records are enduring
    and accreting
    not erase and overriting

Your friends number example
It is not a place in memory


The Point

Values have many advantages
   in process
   accross processes
   in storage
We know these things
Place has no role in an information model


Value

Relative worth
A particular magnitude, number or amount
Precise meaning or significance
