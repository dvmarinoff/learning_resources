* Vectors

   vector - has magnitude and direction

   5mph is just magnitude or scalar quontity
   5mph to each is a vector quontity called speed

   v = (5, 0) = [5, 0] = [5]
                         [0]

   R^2 is the real two-dimentional coordinate space 

   or all possible real-values 2-tuple
   a tuple is ordered list of values

   x = [0,0,0]
   b = [-1,5,3]

   x, b member of R^3
      
   R^n - n-dimentional real coordinate space

** Sum of vectors:

   a = [6,-2], b = [-4,4]

   a + b = [6 + (-4), -2 + 4] = [2,2]

   Graphically they need to be aligned (put the tail of b at the head of a)
   into a triangle, (usualy at the base of the coord sys.) and the
   hypothenuse is the sum of the two vectors

** Multiplying a vector by scalar 
   
   a = [2,1]
   3 * a = 3 * [2,1] = [6,3]
   -1 * a = [-2,-1] - it fliped to the opposite direction

** The unit vector

    i = [1,0]  , x
    j = [0,1]  , y

    v = [2,3] = 2i + 3j

** Parametric representation of lines

    v = [2,1]
    S = { c v | c member of R }
    - a set of colinear vectors

   Find the unit vector in the direction of u = (2,7)

   (2,7) / sqrt(2^2 + 7^2) = (2,7) / sqrt(53) =
   = ( 2/sqrt(53), 7/sqrt(53) )

   Find the component form of v + w:
   
   magnitude v = 3, angle = 30 deg
   (3, 30 deg)
   
   magnitude w = 6, angle = 340 deg
   (6, 340 deg)

   By constructing the right-angled triangle, we have
   the opposite = y*j, and the adjacent = x*i, where
   i and j are the unit vectors.

   From soh cah toa:
   
   sin(30) = x/3
   x = 3 * sin(30 deg) = 3 * 1/2 = 3/2

   cos(30) = y/3
   y = 3 * cos(30) = sqrt(3)/2

   Or more concise:
   
   v + w = (v_x + w_x, v_y + w_y)
   
   = (3 cos(30) + 6 cos(340)), (3 sin(30) + 6 sin(340))

** Vector dot and cross products

   dot product

   a = (3, 1, 8)
   b = (4, 2, 3)

   The dot product of the ordered triple is:

   a * b = (3 * 4) + (1 * 2) + (8 * 3) = 38

   When multiplying matrices, it's useful to think of each
   matrix row and column as an n-tuple:

       c1 c2
   r1 [ 6  2 ]
   r2 [ 4  3 ]

   [ r1 * c1    r1 * c2 ]
   [ r2 * c1    r2 * c2 ]

* Matrices

** Matrix multiplication:

   [2 1] * [1 4]
   [5 2]   [3 6]

   = [ (2*1 + 1*3)   (2*4 + 1*6) ]
     [ (5*1 + 2*3)   (5*4 + 2*6) ]

   = [5    14]
     [11   32]


   by finding dot products of rows from left and cols from right:

   1st row times 1st col     1st row times 2nd col
   2nd row times 1st col     2nd row times 2nd col


   - commutative property of multiplication does not hold
     order matters when we multiply matrices

     A * B != B * A

   - result is not always defined

   We can find the product only if the number of columns
   in the first matix is equal to the number of rows in
   the second matrix. The middle to numbers must be equal:

   rows x cols   rows x cols

   2 x 3   and   3 x 2    yes
   2 x 3   and   2 x 3    no

** Identity matrix 

    1 * x = x   <- identity

    I * A = A

    A = [1 2 3]
        [4 5 6]
        [7 8 9]

    [1 0 0]       [1 2 3]
    [0 1 0] x A = [4 5 6]
    [0 0 1]       [7 8 9]       
                  
   - Multiplicative Inverses

     1/3 * 3 = 1
     3 * 1/3 = 1
    
     All nonzero real numbers have one, but
     not all matrices have multiplicative inverses

   - Dimensions of identity matrix

     It is always going to be square.
     From:

     I    x     A      =    A
     ? x ?      a x b       a x b
     a x a

     - Cols of 1st = Rows of 2nd
     - Rows of product = rows of 1st
