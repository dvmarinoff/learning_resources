* Bayesian Statistics

by Thomas Bayes (1701 - 1761)

It is major part of probability theory
Some philosophers think it is the key to understanding
what it means to think rationaly

Probability:
chance or likelihood that a proposition is true 
expresses belief under uncertainty

Prior Probability:
before new information is available (outcomes in coin case, etc.)

Posterior Probability:


Bayes Rule:

P(H|e) = P(e|H) * P(H) / P(e)

Notation:
P - Probability
H - Hypothesis
e - event
| - conditional probability (probability given event is true)

People often forget about the prior probability of the Hypothesis
or treat P(H|e) as P(e|H) - base rate fallacy

Example:
1 student in a class of 20 has the fly.
Sally is a student.

Prior Probability:
that Sally has the fly is 1/20
P(Sally has the fly) = 0.05

Suppose there are 5 girls and 15 boys.

Conditional Probabilities:
If patient is a girl
P(Sally has the fly | patient is a girl) = 0.20
If patient is a boy
P(Sally has the fly | patient is a boy) = 0
