* Machine Learning

* Week 1

** Intro

Arthur Samuel (1959): field of study that gives computers the
ability to learn without being exolicitly programmed.

in the '50 he wrote a checkers playing program that was able
by just playing 10's of 1000's of games to learn over time
and eventualy became much better than him.

Tom Mitchell (1998): a computer is said to learn from experience
E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P,
if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with
experience E.

Definition:

Example with checkers:
E ::= the experience of playing many games
T ::= the task of playing the game
P ::= the probability of winning the next game

if P to do T increases as E increases it is machine learning


Machine learning algorithms:

Supervised learning
Unsupervised learning
Reinforced learning
Recommender systems

It is important to know the tools, but it is even more important
to know how to use them.

*** Supervised learning

Problem: Predict housing prices

y = price
x = size

So do you want to fit a linear or quadratic function, beacause
diff in price may be significant?

Supervised leraning means that we give the algorithm a data set
in which the "right answers" were given and it just needs to
produce more of them.

Regression problem means we are tring to predict a continuous
value output(the price x in this case).

Classification problem means we are tring to prodict a discreet
valued output.

In those kind of problems we need as many as features to prodict
on as possible. The Support Vector Machine algorithm helps with
a neat math trick that allows a computer to deal with even an
infinite number of features.

*** Unsupervised learning

Unsupervised learning is used where we don't have the labels
for the data and we are tring to find some structure in it.

Clustering algorithm will try to structure the data as clusters.

Problem: Google News topic clusters

One story leeds to others on the same topic.

Other problem domains:

Organise computing clusters
Social network analysis
Market segmentation
Astronomical data analysis

Problem: Cocktail party problem
Person 1     Microphone 1
Person 2     Microphone 2

Task: separate voices of both persons


Two microphones set at different distances(locations) in a
room with people similtaniously talking. Voice overlap in
a different way in each output(always mixed to a speech noice).
The algorithm will sum the outputs and we can clearly
distinguish each persons speech.

A difficult problem solved by researchers with just one line
of code:

[W, s, v] = svd((repmat(sum(x.*x,1), size(x,1),1).*x)*x');

** Model and Cost Function

m = number of training examples
x = "input" variable / features 
y = "output" variable / "target" variable

(x, y) = one training example(row in the table)  
(x^i, y^i) = i-th training example  

| Size (x) | Price (y) |
|----------+-----------|
| 2104     | 460       |
| 1412     | 232       |
| 1534     | 315       |
| ...      | ...       |

x^1 = 2014
y^1 = 460

Training set -> Learning Algorithm -> h() (Hypothesis)

Size h(Predicted price);
h :: Size x-> Predicted Price y

h maps from x to y

h_\theta (x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x

h(x) = a + bx

shorthand: h(x)
\theta 's are parameters of the model

Linear regression: where we use linear function as h(x)

Cost function: will help us fit the best h(x) to our data

In the housing price problem this is the best straight line that
fits the data. We need to minimize \theta_0 and \theta_1 so that
the difference between h(x) and y is small(or the difference
between the predicted value and the target in the data set is
small).

minimize J(\theta_0, \theta_1) = (1/2 * 1/m) * \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h(x) - y)^2

minimize the sum of the squared avarage error

The squared error cost function works well for regression.

[[./img/cost_function_full.jpg]]

** Gradient Discent

a very common general algorithm used to minimize functions.

Outline of the problem:
We have some function J(\theta_0, \theta_1)
We want to minnimaze it.

Start with some \theta_0, \theta_1
Keep changing \theta_0, \theta_1 to reduce J(\theta_0, \theta_1)
until we hopefully end up at a minimum
"We spin 360deg around us, choose the steepest way down and take a
small baby step into that direction, then repeat until you converge
into some minimum."


x = \theta_0
y = \theta_1
z = J(\theta_0, \theta_1)

repeat until convergence {
    \theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha d/d\theta_j J(\theta_0, \theta_1)
    (for j = 0 and j = 1)
}

temp0 := \theta_0 - \alpha d/d\theta_0 J(\theta_0, \theta_1)
temp1 := \theta_1 - \alpha d/d\theta_1 J(\theta_0, \theta_1)

\theta_0 := temp0
\theta_1 := temp1

Note: remember to always update the parameters \theta_0 and \theta_1
simultaniously(ater the calculation not during it);

\alpha - is a number known as the learning rate, which difines the size of the
step that we take downhill.

d/d\theta_j J(\theta_0, \theta_1) - is the derivative term. When at an local
optimum slope is 0. And as we approach a local minimum the steps will
authomatically became smaller.

[[./img/gradient_discent.jpg]]

Gradient discent for Linear Regression

the cost function for the linear regression is going to be a bow shaped
function(a convex function). I t does not have any local optima, just the
global optima.

"batch" gradient discent - at every step we are looking at all the training
examples.

NOTE: Normal equations method is a numeric method to solve for the minimum
using linear algebra, but it does not scale as good as gradiaent discent.


* Week 2

** Multiple Features

multivariable linear regression:

h_\theta (x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + ... + \theta_n x_n

h_\theta (x) = (transpose [\theta_0; \theta_1; ... \theta_n]) x [x_0; x_1; ... x_n] = \theta^T x

x_j^i = value of feature j in i-th training example (col)
x^i = i-th trainig example (row)
m = length of training examples (rows)
n = length of features (cols)

Think of i and j as the counters in a nested loop i is outer j is inner.
i loops the outer layer of training examples and j loops each example
training features.

Note: x_0 = 1 and \theta is n+1 dimentional vector (meaning that they are
passed to the function as one paramter - the vector)

gradient descent for multiple variables:

n >= 1

Repeat {
    \theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha 1/m \sigma_{i=1}^{m}(h_\theta(x^i) - y^i)x_j^i
    (simultaneously update \theta_j for j=0,...,n)
}

[[./img/gradient_discent_multiple_features.jpg]]


Feature scaling:
make sure features are on a similar scale
E.g.
x_1 = size(0-200 feet^2)
x_2 = number of bedrooms(1-5)

Will result in a very tall and skinny contour plot, which requires much
more work to be done by gradient discent.
So we better scale the features:

x_1 = size (feet^2) / 2000
x_2 = number of bedrooms / 5

This will result in less skewed and more circle like contours, which
are much more easy for gradient discent.

Get every feature into approximatly a -1 <= x_i <= 1 range

Mean normalization:
replace x_i with x_i - \mu_i to make features have approximately zero mean
(Do not apply to x_0 = 1). E.g.

x_1 = size - 1000 / 2000
x_2 = #bedrooms - 2 / 5

-0.5 <= x_1 <= 0.5
-0.5 <= x_2 <= 0.5

x_i = x_i - \mu_i / S_i

where \mu_i is the avarage value of x_i in the training set
and S_i is the range (max - min) or standart deviation.

Learning Rate (\alpha):

How to make sure that gradient discent is working correctly?
J(\theta) should decrease after every iteration.
Check the J, iterations graph.
It also possible to use automatic convergence test. Declare convergence if
J(\theta) decreases by less than 10^-3 in one iteration.

Possible solutions:
If J(\theta) is increasing or first decreasing a then increasing try using
smaller \alpha to avoid overshooting the minimum.
But if it is too small it will take many steps to converge.
To choose \alpha try: 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1
try 3x bigger values until you choose the best largest one.

NOTE: When to stop the gradient descent iterations? Will it converge?
When the cost start to osciliate around a value appearing to very slowly
converge to it, we are close to a minimum. But it is also possible that
we've hit an inflection point, which by it self is not a minimum, but
may excibit a similar behavior.

NOTE: momentum is a way to optimeze the gradient descent algorithm and
make it pass over small 'hills' and not try to find a way around them.

Features and polynomial regression:

NOTE: it is even more important to scale your data when different features
may be of the form x_1^2 x_2^3 ...

** Computing Parameters Analytically

Normal equation:
for some linear regression problems will give us a much better way to
solve for optimal value of the parameters \theta. 


the X matrix and the y matrix:

[[./img/normal_equation.jpg]]

The formula for minimizing J(\theta):
\theta = (X^T X)^-1 X^T y

where X^T = X transposed and X^-1 = inverse of X

To compute in octave:

pinv(X' * X) * X' * y


NOTE: feature scaling is not needed in normal equation method

When to use what?

Gradient discent:
Works well even when n is large(number of features)
Need to choose \alpha
Needs many iterations

Normal equation:
No need to choose \alpha
Don't need to iterate
Need to compute (X^T X)^-1 and n x n invertion is O(n^3)
Slow if n is very large (n = 10000 may be too much)

Noninvertability:

What X^T X is non-invertable?

pinv - compute seudo-inverse
inv - compute inverse

May be because of:
Redundant features(linearly dependent).
E.g.
x_1 = size in feet^2
x_2 = size in m^2

Too many features
m <= n

* Week 3

** Classification and Representation

*** Classification

A class of problesms where the output value that we want to predict is a
descrete value.

For example:
Email: spam/not spam?
Online Transaction: fradulent(yes/no)?

y \in {0,1}

0: "Negative Class"
1: "Positive Class"

if y \in {0,1,2,3,4} this is called multi class problem

An approach to solve a classification problem with linear regression is
to run a threshold line from y=0.5 to the point where it crosses the
hypothesis line (0 <= y <= 1). and if h(x) >= 0.5 predict y=1 else if
h(x) < 0.5 predict y=0.
The problem here is that examples with high x values (positioned very
far right on the x-axis) will drag the hypothesis line towards them.
Ultimately linear regression wont work, just because classification
is not a linear problem.

*** Logistic Regression Model

Instead we want to use Logistic Regression, which despite of the name
is one of the most popular and used classification algoritms.

in lineear regression the model was:
h_\theta(x) = \theta^T x

for logistic regression we want only to midify it:
h_\theta(x) = g(\theta^T x)

where

g(z) = 1 / 1 + e^-z

which is known as a sigmoid function(logistic funciton).
If we put does 2 equations together we get: 

h_\theta(x) = 1 / 1 + e^{-\theta^{T} x}

The sigmoid funciton crosses y at 0.5 and has asimptotes at y=0 and y=1.

We interpret the output of h\theta(x) as the estimated probability that
y equals 1 on the input x.

h\theta(x) = P(y=2|x;\theta)
reas as: probability that y=1, given x, parameterized by \theta.

P(y=0|x;\theta) + P(y=1|x;\theta) = 1

P(y=0|x;\theta) = 1 - P(y=1|x;\theta)

The sigmoid function squishes the number line between 0 and 1. It is also
known as the logistic curve. Very negative inputs end up close to zero
and very positive inputs end up close to 1, and it just steadily
increases around the input 0.
For modern neural networks the ReLU is used, because it is easier to
train(Rectified Linear Unit). It takes a max of 0 and the other input.
If it  passes a certain treshold it would be the identity function.
But if it did not than it would just not be activated so be 0.
It happens to learn much faster then with the sigmoid function.


*** Decision Boundary

The decision boundry is a property of the hypotesis and the parameters
of the hypothesis and not a property of the dataset.

Predict that y=1 if \theta^{T} x >= 0

h\theta(x)=g(\theta_{0} + \theta_{1} x_{1} + \theta_{2} x_{2})

-3 + x_{1} + x_{2} >= 0
x_{1} + x_{2}>= 3

x_{1} + x_{2} = 3 corresponds to the h_{\theta}(x) = 0.5

[[./img/decision_boundary.jpg]]

Non-linear decision boundary:

if we add polynomial terms to the hypothesis we can get a more
complex funciton to fit on our classifier.

x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2} = 1 is the equation for a circle with radius 1, and it can
fit y = 1 outside the circle and y = 0 inside the circle.

[[./img/nonlinear_decision_boundary.jpg]]

*** Cost Function

We have a training set of m examples and it is represented with a feature
vector that is R^{n+1} and has the zero feature x_0 = 1, and because it
is a classification problem our training set has the property that y is
0 or 1.

How do we fit the parameters \theta?

[[./img/logistic_reg_cost_problem.jpg]]

We need to rewrite the cost function.

Cost(h_{\theta}(x), y) = 1/(h_{\theta}(x) - y)^{2}

But because of the sigmoid function in logistic regression our cost is
now a non convex function and those are hard to optimize.

When the algorithm predicts h(x) is y it is going to pay a cost:

-log(h(x))       if y was 1 and
-log(1 - h(x))   if y was 0

[[./img/log_cost_function.jpg]]

Cost = 0 if y=1, h(x)=1
But as h(x) \to 0 Cost \to \inf


[[./img/log_cost_function_y0.jpg]]

Turns out there is a way to simplify our function and compress
the 2 conditional cases into one:

[[./img/simplified_cost_function.jpg]]


Gradient descent for logistic regression:

[[./img/gradient_descent_logistic_regression.jpg]]


*** Advaced Optimization

Optimization algorithms:
- Gradient Descent
- Conjugate gradient
- BFGS
- L-BFGS

The last 3 use more and more sophisticated strategies to minimaze the
cost function. They have more clever inner loop called line search
algorithm that tries out automatically different values for the
learning rate alpha and picks to ultimate one. They also converge
much faster through other optimizations.

Advatages:
- no need ti manually pick \alpha
- ofden faster than gradient descent
Disadvantages:
- more complex

** Multiclass Classification

Email foldering/tagging: Work, Friends, Family, Hobby

y = [ 1: "Work"; 2: "Friends"; 3: "Family"; 4: "Hobby"];

One vs All(Rest) classification method turns multiclass a problem into
multiple binary classifications.
Train a logistic regression classifier h_\theta^i(x) for each class i
to predict the probability that y = i. max_i h_\theta^i(x).

h_{\theta}^{1}(x)

h_{\theta}^{2}(x)

h_{\theta}^{3}(x)

[[./img/onevsall_multiclass_classifier.jpg]]



** Overfitting

*** The Problem of Overfitting

Underfitting is when the  algorithm has "high bias", stong preconceptions
about the data. It is trying to fit a line to a more complex set.

Overfitting is when the algorithm has "high variance", the space of
possible hypothesis is too large and we don't have enough data to constrain
it to give us a good hypothesis.
In other words if we have too many features, the learned hypothesis may
fit the training set very well J(\theta) ~ 0, but fail to generalize to
new examples.

To avoid:
try to reduce the number of features
regularization - keep all the features, but reduce magnitude/values of
parameters \theta_{j}

*** Regularization

When we have too many terms in our hypothesis function it may start to
overfit. To solve this we can try to reduce the weight of some of those
terms by increasing the their cost.

For example by making a n^4 (high order polynomial) function more like
n^2 (quadratic):

\theta_{0} + \theta_{1}x_{1} + \theta_{2}x_{2}^{2} + \theta_{3}x_{3}^{3} + \theta_{4}x_{4}^{4}

a + b^{2} + c^{3} + d^{4}

Again we don't want to eliminate these features because they are important
for our model, but we can increase their cost:

(\sum_{i=1}^{m} (a + b^{2})) + 1000*c^{2} + 1000*d^{2}

if we don't know which parameters to shrink we can use the \lambda
regularization parameter and summation over all of them:

\lambda \sum_{i=1}^{n} \theta_{j}^{2}

What the \lambda parameter does is to control the trade off between our to
goals. The goal of fitting the training set well by using more and more
complex parameter terms in our hypothesis and the goal of keeping the
hypothesis simple and the parameters small so we avoid overfitting.


if we set the value of \lambda too high it will
if we set it to 0 this will eliminate the effect of the parameters and
make them equal to 0, which is underfitting (maybe a straight line or
something).

* Non-linear hypothesis (Neural Networks I)

** Motivations

When you want to apply a logistic regression to a more complex data set
you may add a lot of noni-linear features. So we include a lot of
polynomial terms in the hypothesis. But even when we consider just 2
features x_{1} and x_{2} this gets complex. What if we have a 100 features
and we want to use most of them.

n = 100;

asymptotically the number of quadratic features grows roughly as:
O(n*{2}),  but is actually closer to n^{2}/2. This may end up
overfitting and is computationaly expansive.
On the other end we may just include the quadratic features:
x_{1}^{2}, x_{2}^{2}, x_{3}^{2}, ... , x_{100}^{2}
those might be too little and it will underfit.
If we add the cubic features this will grow O(n^{3}).

Example: Computer Vision

a grid of pixel intensity values

50x50 pixel images -> n = 2500 pixels, and n = 7500 pixels if RGB

x = [ pixel 1; pixel 2; ... pixel 2500; ];

Quadratic features for n = 2500, will be 2500^{2}/2 ~ 3 million features

Complex non-linear hypothesis are one of the advantages of neural
network algorithms.

** Model Representation

parameters are called weights,
sigmoid function is called activation function,

Input Layer -> Hidden Layer -> Output Layer -> h_{\theta}(x)

a_{i}^{(i)} = "activation" of unit i in layer j

\theta^{j} = matrix of weights controlling function mapping from layer
j to layer j + 1


[[./img/logistic_unit.jpg]]

[[./img/neural_network_model1.jpg]]

Froward propagation: vectorized implementation

x = [x_{0}; x_{1}; x_{2}; x_{3}];

z^{(2)} = [z_{1}^{(2)}; z_{2}^{(2)}; z_{3}^{(2)}; z_{4}^{(2)};];

z^{(2)} = \Theta^{(1)}.a^{(1)}

a^{(2)} = g(z^{(2)})

where g() is the activation function applied element-wise

add a_{0}^{(2)} = 1, now:

z^{(3)} = \Theta^{(2)}.a^{(2)}

h_{\Theta}(x) = a^{(3)} = g(z^{(3)})

a_{3}^{(2)} =g(z_{3}^{(2)}) 

** Applications

XOR/XNOR

x_{1}, x_{2} are binary(0 or 1) input features

y = x_{1} XOR x_{2},
    x_{1} XNOR x_{2},
    NOT (x_{1} XOR x_{2})

Simple Example:

x_{1}, x_{2} \in {0,1}, y = x_{1} AND x_{2}

[[./img/AND_1layered_nn.png]]

\Theta_{10}^{(1)} = -30;
\Theta_{11}^{(1)} = +20;
\Theta_{12}^{(1)} = +20;

h_{\theta}(x) = g(\Theta_{10}^{(1)} + \Theta_{11}^{(1)}x_{1} + \Theta_{12}^{(1)}x_{2})

h_{\theta}(x) = g(-30 + 20x_{1} + 20x_{2})

| x_{1} } | x_{2} | h_{theta}(x)|
|---------+-------+-------------|
|    0    |   0   |      0      |
|    0    |   1   |      0      |
|    1    |   0   |      0      |
|    1    |   1   |      1      |



** Activation Functions for Neural Networks

When it comes to neural networks the sigmoid and the ReLU are know
as activation functions. They help by introducing non-linearity to
our model. Linear equations are easy to solve but they are limited
in their complexity. Neural Networks are considered Universal
Function Approximators, that mean they can compute any function,
and any procees can be represented as function computation.
If we use just linear function s our multi layered network we
behave like a single layered, because summing those layers would
give us just another linear function.
With Non-linear activation functions the mapping of the input to the
output is non-linear and we also want it to be differentiable so we
can perform the backpropagation optimization strategy where we find
a non-linear error gradient to learn complex behavior.

Input * weight + bias -> Activate?

- Sigmoid

f(x) = 1 / 1 + e^{-x} 

f'(x) = e^{-x} / (1 + e^{-x})^{2}

    Disadvatages:

        - Vanishing and exloding gradients
        
        when neuron activation saturates close to 0 or 1 the gradient at
        these regions is very close to zero during backpropagation this
        local gradient will be multiplied by the gradient of this gate
        output for the whole objective so if the local gradient is treally
        small it will make the gradient slowly vanish and close to no
        signal will flow through the neuron to its weights and recursevely
        to its data.

        - Output is not zero centered
        
        starts 0 and ends up 1, so the value after the function will be
        positive and that makes the gradient of the weights become either
        all positive or all negative. This makes the gradient updates go
        too far in different directions which makes optimization harder.

        - Slow convergence

- Tanh(Hyperbolic Tangent Function)

f(x) = (2 / 1 + e^{-2x}) -1

with asymtotes around -1 and +1

It squoshes the real number into a range between -1 and +1. So its ouput
is zero centered. Which makes optimization easier. But also suffers from
the vanishing gradient problem.
    
- ReLU(Rectified Liner Unit)

f(x) = max(0, x);

if x > 0 f'(x) = 1

if x <= 0 f'(x) = 0

value is 0 when x < 0 and linear with a slope of 1 when x > 0.
It is the most simple solution and does not require expensive computations
and avoids the vanishing gradient problem.
It had 6x improvement in convergence over Tanh.
It is only used for the hidden layers, the output layer should use a
soft max function for classification since it gives probabilities for
different classes and a linear function for regression since the signal
goes through unchanged.
One problem that ReLU has is that some units can be fragile during
training, meaning a big gradient flowing through a ReLU neuron could
cause a weight update that makes it never activate on any data point
again so than gradients flowing through it will always be 0 froma that
point on.
So a variant was introduced called Leaky ReLU. Instead of the function
being 0 when x < 0, it has a small negative slope.
Max out is another popular variant. It ois a generalizaed form of both
ReLU and Leaky ReLU, but it doubles the number of parameters for each
neuron so there is a trade off.

In summary use ReLU on the hidden layers and on the output Soft Max for
classification or a linear function for regression.

*** Collections:

   Seqs are mutable(list) and immutable(tuple, range)

**** tuple

>>> t = (1,2,3,4)

    immutable,
    collection
    - packing and unpacking

>>> t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!'
>>> x, y, z = t


**** list

>>> l = [1,2,3,4]

    mutable,
    more like array or vector or linked-list?
    - methods:
      .append(x)                - adds at the end
      .extend(iterable)
      .insert(i, x)
      .remove(x)                - remove first by value
      .pop([i])                 - if no arg, returns last
      .clear()
      .index(x[,start[,end]])   - return 0-based index of value
      .count
      .sort
      .reverse
      .copy
      del a[i:j]                - removes by index at pos or range

    - as stacks:
      with .append() and .pop()

    - as queues:
      with .append() and .pop(0)

    - list comprehensions:

>>> [x**2 for x in range(10)]
>>> [x for x in vec if x >= 0]
>>> [(x, x**2) for x in range(6)]

>>> # flatten a list using a listcomp with two 'for'

>>> vec = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]
>>> [num for elem in vec for num in elem]

Out[]: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

    - queues: better use collections deque

>>> from collections import deque
>>> queue = deque(["Eric", "John", "Michael"])
>>> queue.append("Terry")           # Terry arrives
>>> queue.append("Graham")          # Graham arrives
>>> queue.popleft()

    - map:

>>> squares = list(map(lambda x: x**2, range(10)))

    - reduce:
>>>

    - filter:

**** dict

>>> tel = {'jack': 4098, 'sape': 4139}

    classical hash map

    - methods:
    d[key]                 - to access by key
    del d[key]             - remove
    .iter(d)               - return an iterator over the keys of the dictionary
    .clear()
    .copy()
    .get(key[,default])    - get value else default value
    .keys()
    .values()
    .items()
    .pop(key[,default])
    .popitem()             - remove arbitrary
    .update([other])       - overwrites existing

>>> dict([('sape', 4139), ('guido', 4127), ('jack', 4098)])
>>> dict(sape=4139, guido=4127, jack=4098)

**** set

>>> basket = {'apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana'}

    like math sets

>>> 'orange' in basket
Out[]: True

>>> a = set('abracadabra')
Out[]: {'a', 'r', 'b', 'c', 'd'} # unique letters in a


**** range

>>> range(1,10)

    range(start, stop, step)

    it is useful, because it is more efficient. Values are generated only when needed
    lazy seq

**** Common Seq Operations

    x in s 	              True if an item of s is equal to x, else False
    x not in s 	          False if an item of s is equal to x, else True
    s + t 	              the concatenation of s and t
    s * n or n * s 	      equivalent to adding s to itself n times
    s[i] 	                ith item of s, origin 0
    s[i:j] 	              slice of s from i to j
    s[i:j:k] 	            slice of s from i to j with step k
    len(s) 	              length of s
    min(s) 	              smallest item of s
    max(s) 	              largest item of s
    s.index(x[, i[, j]]) 	index of the first occurrence of x in s (at or after index i and before index j)
    s.count(x)

** Functions:

- argument lists
- keyword arguments
- default arguments

*** Unsupervised learning

    The data set has no 'right answers'/labels given,
    we have to find the structure into the data

    Task: Google News group stories
    Task: Genomics shared by individuals
    Task: Organize computer clusters
    Task: Social networks
    Task: Market Segmentation
    Task: Astronomical data analysis

** Deep learning for NLP

    Traditional machine learning uses more 'hard-coded' methods and requires
    experienced and deeply knowlegable domain specialists to code them.
    Deep learning uses vectors as more efficient and simpler abstraction
    in order to turn tml on its head.

    Representations of language

    |           |      TML         |    DL   |
    +-----------+------------------+---------+
    | phonology | all phonemes     | vectors |
    | morphology| all morphemes    | vectors |
    | words     | one-hot encoding | vectors |
    | syntax    | phrase rules     | vectors |
    | semantics | lambda calculus  | vectors |

    NOTE: one-hot encoding (uses matrix, not very efficient)

    |     | The | cat | sat | on | the | mat |
    | The |  1  |  0  |  0  |  0 |  1  |  0  |
    | cat |  0  |  1  |  0  |  0 |  0  |  0  |
    ...

    Applications

    Easy: spell checking, synonym suggestions, keyword search
    easy to bruteforce with tml

    Intermediate:
    reading level,
    extracting information,
    predicting next word,
    classification

    Complex:
    machine translation,
    quation answering,
    chatbots,

** RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)

Vanila NNs and Convolutional NNs have constrained API
They operate over fixed:
input vectors, output vectors and computational steps

RNNs allow to operate over sequances of vectors

RNNs might be just unreasonably effective,
despite them being considered hard to train

Input Sequence Vectors <-> State Vectors -> Output Sequence Vectors


They are Turing-Complete
If training vanilla neural nets is optimization over functions,
training recurrent nets is optimization over programs


* Statistics Review

Example: xs = [2, 4, 8, 10, 12];

- Mean (\mu): 7.2
the sum of the population / by the size of the polulation

- Median: 8
just the number in the middle of a sorted population

- Variance (\sigma^{2}): 13.76
avarage of the squared difference from the mean

- Standart Deviation (\sigma): 3.71
square root from the variance

how spread the numbers are

The formula:

\sigma = sqrt(1/n \sum_{i=0}^{n} (x_{i} - \mu)^{2})


The code:

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
function variance(xs)
    n = size(xs, 1);
    μ = sum(xs) / n;
    sum(map(x -> (μ - x)^2, xs)) / n;
end

function standartDeviation(xs)
    sqrt(variance(xs));
end
#+END_SRC

or with lambdas:

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
n(xs) = size(xs, 1);                              # size of the population
mu(xs, n) = sum(xs) / n;                          # mean avarage
var(xs, μ, n) = sum(map(x -> (μ - x)^2, xs)) / n; # variance
stdd(xs, μ) = sqrt(var2(xs));                     # standart deviation(population)

stdd(xs, mu(xs, n(xs)));                          # compute standart deviation 
#+END_SRC
