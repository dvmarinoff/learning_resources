* Limits and Continuity

** ex.1: Limit

lim f(x) = 4
x->3

lim f(x) = 4
x->3-

lim f(x) = 4
x->3+

- the limit of f of x as x approaches 3 is 4
- the limit as we approach from the left is 4
- the limit as we aproach from the right is 4

** ex.2: Right and Left

lim f(x) = -4
x->3-

lim f(x) = 1
x->3+

- the function is discontinuos at x = 3,
- we have 2 limits from right and left, but
- the limit at x->3 does not exist

- the value of a function is not the same as the limit of the function
- we predict the limit by approximating infinitly close to the value,
but the value may be undefined, and the function can still have a limit,
- but if the value is infinity, we are infinitly approximating infinity
and in this case the limit does not exist from that direction


** ex.3: Continuity

*** Over a point
f is continuos when x=a if and only if

lim f(x) = f(a) 
x->a

*** Over an interval

f is cont. over (a,b) if and only if
f is cont. over every point in that interval

f is cont. over [a,b] if and only if

lim f(x) = f(a) and lim f(x) = f(b)
x->a+               x->b-

** Properties of Limits

lim f(x) = L    lim g(x) = M
x->a            x->a

lim( f(x) + g(x) ) = L + M     | Sum
x-> a

lim ( f(x) - g(x) ) = L - M    |  
x->a

lim ( f(x) * g(x) ) = L * M    | Product
x->a

lim ( f(x) / g(x) ) = L / M    | Difference

lim f(g(x)) = lim f( lim g(a) )| Composition
x->a


** Limits by substitution, factoring and rationalizing

ex.4:

f(x) = x^2 + x - 6 / x - 2 = (x + 3)(x - 2) / (x - 2) = x + 3 , x != 2

f(x) { x + 3     , x != 2
     { undefined , x = 2

lim f(x) = ?
x->2

ex.5:

lim x + 1/ sqrt(x + 5) - 2 = ?    | 0/0 
x-> -1

g(x) = x + 1/ sqrt(x + 5) - 2 =

= (x + 1 / sqrt(x + 5) - 2) * (sqrt(x + 5) + 2 / sqrt(x + 5) + 2) =

= (x + 1)(sqrt(x + 5) + 2) / x + 5 - 4 = sqrt(x + 5) + 2 , x !0= -1  

f(x) = sqrt(x + 5) + 2
f(x) = g(x) for all x != 1

lim g(x) = 4
x-> -1


(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2


** Limits of trigonometric functions

ex.6:

lim sin(x) = ? = sin(π) = 0
x-> π

sin and cos are defined for all real numbers and are continuos
over thier entire domain (tan and cot are also continuous), and
thier limit will be the value of the function at that point 


lim tan(x) = lim sin(x)/cos(x) = 0 / -1 = 0 
x-> π

lim cot(x) = lim cos(x)/sin(x) = 
x-> π

sin π = sin(π/2 + π/2) = cos π/2 = 0
sin(π) = 0
cos(0) = 1
cos(π) = -1
cos(π/2) = 0


Note: 0/0 is undetermined form -> the limit may still exist


*** Squeeze theorem (Sandwich theorem)

Calories:
Imran <= Diya <= Sal

Tuesday: 1500 <= x <= 1500    -> x = 1500

The math vertion for functions

f(x) <= g(x) <= h(x)

lim f(x) = L    lim h(x) = L
x->a            x->a

-> lim g(x) = L
   x->a

*** lim sin(x)/x
    x-> 0      





* Derivatives

** Intro to derivatives

1) The 'instantanious' rate of change

2) Derivatives are about looking at tiny changes to some quontity
and how that relates to a resulting tiny change in another quontity
 
3) derivative is equal to the slope of a line tangent to the graph
at a single point

- avarage rate of change formula, slope

the slope of a curve is always changing at each point

f(b) - f(a) / b - a

- derivative 

f'(x) = \frac{df}{dx} = \lim_{x\to\0} = \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}

#+STARTUP: latexpreview
\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
#+STARTUP: nolatexpreview

- differentiability - does the function have a defined derivative at a point

if f is differentiable at x = a, then f is continuous x = a

f is not differebtiable if:
1) if f not continuous at x = a, then f is not differentiable
2) if f have vertical tangent at x= a f is not differentiable at x = 0
3) 'sharp turn' - as we approach the point from left or right slope of tangent is different
   
f(x) = abs(x) is not differentiable at the point of the 'sharp turn' 

- tangent line equation

to get slope of the tangent line at the point a (derivative):

\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}

to get tangent line equation (using the derivative):

f(x) = x^3
slope = 3
point = (-1,-1)

3 = y - (-1) / x - (-1)
y = 3x + 2

for
y = mx + b
where m is the slope and b is the y intercept
or

(y-y1) / (x - x1) = b
 
- Local linearity

The concept:
if we zoom enough on a non-linear function it will
start looking as a linear function

[[./img/local_linearity.jpg]]

Try that on:
y = x^1000
and zoom at the 'sharp turn', it will bein to look linear

Find approximation of the sqrt 4.36 without calculator?

$ \sqrt{4.36} = ? $

$ \sqrt{4} = 2 $

f(4) = 2
f(4.36) = ?

$ f(x) = \sqrt{x} = x^1/2 $

If we find the equation for the tangent line at f(4) we may approximate the f(4.36):

L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)*(x-a)

L(x) = f(4) + f'(4)*(x-4)

From Power rule:
f'(x) = 1/2 * x^-1/2
f'(4) = 1/4 

L(4.36) = f(4) + f'(4)*(4.36 - 4)
= 2 + 1/4 * 0.36 
= 2 + 0.09
= 2.09

$ 2.09^2 = 4,3681 $

$ \sqrt{4.36} = 2.088061 $

** Derivatives rules

*** Basic rules

1) Constant rule 

f(x) = k
-> f'(x) 0

2) Constant multiple rule

f(x) = k g(x)
-> f'(x) = k g'(x)

3) Sum rule
- of two functions

f(x) = g(x) + j(x)
-> f'(x) = g'(x) + j'(x)

*** Power rule

d/dx [x^n] = nx^n-1 , n != 0

NOTE:
derivative of x is 1x^0 = 1

*** Derivative of sin and cos

d/dx sin = cos

d/dx cos = -sin

*** Derivative of e^x and ln(x) 

d/dx [sin x] = cos x
d/dx [cos x] = -sin x
d/dx [tan x] = 1/cos^2(x) = sec^2(x)

d/dx [e^x] = e^x

slope of the tangent line at any point on e^x equals the value of e^x

d/dx [ln x] = 1/x = x^-1

fills the gap in the power rule

d/dx [ln(4x)] = 4/4x

*** Product rule


d/dx[f(x) * g(x)] = f'(x)*g(x) + f(x)*g'(x)

*** Quotent rule

f(x) = u(x)/v(x)

f'(x) = u'(x)*v(x) - u(x)*v'(x) / [v(x)]^2

*** Chain Rule

the most common one, any time your function
can be used as composition of more than one funtions

h(x) = (sin x)^2 = sin^2(x)

h'(x) = dh/dx = 2sin(x) * cos(x)

from

a^2 = 2a
sin(x) = cos(x)

d/dx [f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)

d/dx [f(g(h(x)))] = f'( g(h(x)) ) * g'(x) * h'(x)

Ex.:

d/dx [sin(ln(x^2))] = ?

f(x) = sin(x)  f'(x) = cos(x)
g(x) = ln(x)   g'(x) = 1/x
h(x) = x^2     h'(x) = 2x

cos(ln(x^2)) * 1/x^2 * 2x
= 2/x * cos(ln(x^2))

*** Log differentiation

d/dx [ln x] = 1/x

d/dx [log_a(x)] = 1 / (ln a) * x

Remember that:

log_a(b) = log_d(a) / log_d(b)

d/dx [log_4(x)] = 1 / (ln 4) * x


Ex:

d/dx [sin(ln(x^2))] = ?

f(x) = sin(x)
g(x) = ln(x)
h(x) = x^2

= cos(ln(x^2) * 1/x * 2x
= 2 * cos(ln(x^2))

*** Trigonometric function differentiation

d/dx[tan(x)] = d/dx[sin(x)/cos(x)] = 1/cos^2(x) = sec^2(x)

d/dx[cot(x)] = d/dx[cos(x)/six(x)] = -1/sin^2(x) = -csc^2(x) 

d/dx[sec(x)] = d/dx[1/cos(x)] = sin(x)/cos^2(x) 

d/dx[csc(x)] = d/dx[1/sin(x)] = -cos(x)/sin^2(x)

*** Second derivatives

*** Implicit differentiation


*** Parametric functions



* Existence theorems

if f(x) is continuoue over the closed interval [a,b]

*** Intermediate Value Theorem

'There exist a c that lies on L'

Suppose f is a function continuous at every point
of the interval [a,b]:

- f will take on every value between
 f(a) and f(b) over the interval

- For any L between the value f(a) and f(b),
 there exists a number c in [a,b] for which f(c) = L

*** Extream Value Theorem

'There exist values where the function takes a maximum and a minimum'

f cont. over [a,b] -> Exists absolute maximum and
absolute minimum value of f

*** Mean Value Theorem

'If also differeniable over the open interval (a,b)
There exists a pint c where the derivative of f(x)
(slope of the tangent line at that point) is the same
as the avarage rate of change'


NOTE: Differentiability implies continuity

[[./img/existence_theorems_intro.jpg]]


* Using Derivatives to Analyze Functions

** L'Hopital's rule

Using derivatives to take limits
Useful in special case of undetermined form:

{0}/{0}

\infty/\infty

-\infty/\infty



\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = 0

and

\lim_{x\to a} g(x) = 0

and

\lim_{x\to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = L 

Then:

\lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L

[[./img/l'hopital's_rule.jpg]]


** Minimun and Maximum

f(c) is a relative maximum
if f(c) >= f(x)
for All x member of (c - h, c + h) for h > 0

f(d) is a relative minimum
if f(d) <= f(x)
for All x member of (d - h, d + h) for h > 0

** Analyzing a function with its derivative

When f'(x) is below the x axis f(x) is decreasing

Example:

f(x) = x^3 - 12x + 2
f'(x) = 3x^2 -12

3x^2 - 12 = 0
x^2 = 4
->
x = 2, x = -2

f'(2) = 0, f'(-2) = 0

so f(x) has critical points at x = 2 and x = -2

[[./img/analyzing_function_with_its_derivative.jpg]]

** Critical points

non endpoint, min or max at x = a ->
f'(a) = 0
f'(a) = undefined

but not when the function is also undefined at that point


Example: Finding critical points of a function

f(x) = xe^(-2x^2)

From product and chain rule:

f'(x) = d/dx[x]e^(-2x^2) + d/dx[e^(-2x^2)]x

= 1e^(-2x^2) + e^(-2x^2)*(-4x)*x

= e^(-2x^2) * (1 - 4x^2)

we can get it equal to 0 only when (1 - 4x^2) is equal to 0

1 - 4x^2 = 0
x^2 = 1/4
x = 1/2, x = -1/2

critical points are at 1/2 and -1/2 



Example: Finding decreasing interval

f(x) = x^6 - 3x^5

f'(x) = 6x^5 - 15x^4

6x^5 - 15x^4 < 0

3x^4(2x - 5) < 0

(3x^4 < 0 AND 2x - 5 > 0) OR (3x^4 > 0 AND 2x - 5 < 0)

x^4 < 0 will never be less than 0 and x != 0

2x - 5 < 0

x < 5/2

-> the decreasing interval is

x < 0 OR x 0 > x < 5/2



Example: Finding inceasing interval

g'(x) = x^2 / (x - 2)^3


x^2 / (x - 2)^3 > 0

(x - 2)^3 > 0

x > 2

(2, \inf)


*** Practice: 
Find critical points of:
01. g(x) = x^3 + x^2 + x
g'(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1
3x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0
3x(x + 2/3) = -1

It is never undefined or 0
No critical points

02. h(x) = sqrt(x^2 + 4)
h'(x) = 1/2(x^2 + 4)^-1/2 * 2x

x = 0 undifined

03. h(x) = e^(2x-6) - e
h'(x) = e^(2x-6) * d/dx[2x - 6]
= 2 * e^(2x-6)

2e^(2x-6) = 0 has no solutions and is never undefined
No critical points

04. h(x) = 4x^2 / x^2 - 1
h'(x) = (8x * (x^2 - 1)) - (2x * (4x^2)) / (x^2 -1)^2
= 8x^3 - 8x - 8x^3 / x^4 + 1 
= -8x / x^4 + 1

x = 0 is undefined

05. f(x) = 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x
f'(x) = 6x^2 - 18x + 12
6x^2 - 18x + 12 = 0
6x(x - 3 + 12/6x) = 0
or
6(x - 1)(x - 2) = 0

x = 1 and x = 2 

06. h(x) = e^(2x) / x - 3
h'(x) = 2e^(2x) * (x - 3) - e^(2x) / (x - 3)^2
= -7e^(2x) + 2x*e^2x = e^(2x)*(2x - 7)  

x = 7/2 is equal to 0
x = -3 is undefind, but also h(x) is undefined so it is not a critical point 

07.


** Finding relative extrema

Relative maximum
When does g' go from g'>0 to g'<0 (from positive to negative value)

Example: Find revalive extrema of g(x) = x^4 - x^5
g'(x) = 0 when

4x^3 - 5x^4 = 0
x^3(4 - 5x) = 0

x^3 = 0, x = 4/5 are critical points

g'(x) = undefined when
never

Analyze values (graph) of the derivative:

| interval   | value          | direction | 
|------------+----------------+-----------|
| (-\inf, 0) | g'(-1) = -9    | dec       |
| (0, 1)     | g'(1/2) = 3/16 | inc       |
| (1, \inf)  | g'(1) = -1     | dec       |

Note:
it may be the case that derivative is 0, but that critical
point is not an extremum. For example when the value (graph)
is positive goes to 0 thean back to being positive

|graph            | local exremum |
|-----------------+---------------|
| pos -> 0 -> neg | maximum       |
| neg -> 0 -> pos | minimum       |
| pos -> 0 -> pos | false         |
| neg -> 0 -> neg | false         |

1 radian = 1 radius

How many radians in a 360deg(circle)?

  Theta is the angle between the x and radius

  less than 90 deg, but breaks on the circle

  sin Theta = Opposite/Hypotenuse = a / 1 = a

  cos Theta = Opposite/Hypotenuse = b / 1 = b

  The point (a,b) on the circle gives us the sin and cos of Theta
  
  
  tangens, cosecant, secant and cotangent:

  tan T = sin T / cos T = opposite / adjacent 
  
  csc T = 1 / sin T = hypotenuse / opposite = h / a

  sec T = 1 / cos T = hypothenuse / adjacent = h / b

  cot T = 1 / tan A = adjacent / opposite = b / a

** Quantum Field Theory

*** Is Quantum tunneling faster then light?

Certain properties of an object are fundamentaly uncertain.
They must be described as a distribution of possible states of being.
Each specific state has a certain probability of being true when the
object is observed.

Until a quantum object interacts with something
all possible states are just real as each other.
Although not necessaraliy equally likely.

There is a distribution of probabilities for each of an objects's quantum
properties. That distribution, and the way it changes over time, is coded
in the object's wave function. The reduction of a fuzzy posibility space
into a specific measurable property is referred to as the collapse of the
wave function.

Louis de Broglie(broie) figured out that any material object is really a
matter wave. It can be described as a wave packet of positioned probability.
And it has a wavelength - de Broglie wave length, that defines how well
determined an object's position is.
A large wavelength means a highly uncertain position, a small wavelength
means well-defined position. That's true of subatomic particles and it's
sort of true of anything.

"Observe me and collapse my wave function"

Objects wavelength depends on its momentum (mass times velocity).
Higher momentum means a smaller wavelength.
Its the minuscule Plank constant divided by momentum.

\lambda = h / p

Humans are made of several tens of kilograms of thermal moving particles
and have de Broglie wavelengths a couple of orders of magnitude smaller
than the Plank wavelength.

"You are everywhere in the universe, but not very much. You are as right
there as possible to be."

But what about something much smaller?

Say a tightly bound bundle of two protons and two neutrons that we call
an alpha particle. On it's own this would be a helium nucleus. But these
bundles also exist as parts of heavier atomic nuclei. There an alpha
particle is snugly bound into the nucleus by the strong nuclear force.

We can imagine an alpha particle as being like a ball trapped in a steep
valley of potential energy. It can roll around inside, but unless it has
a very large kinetic energy, it will never roll over the edges.

[[./img/potential_energy_valley.jpg]]

But quabtum objects aren't at al like balls. Their positions are not well
defined. As an alpha particle approaches the force barrier of nucleus,
its wave packet is reflected backwards, ... usualy. That wave packet
describes a range of possible locations for the approaching particle.
But that possibility space does not end suddenly at the force barrier.
Instead, it drops off quickly, exponentially, through the steep walls.
However it never quite reaches zero. There remains a tiny tail of
probability outside the nucleus, beyond the reach of the strong nuclear
force. That means there is a very tiny chance that instead of bouncing
off the wall, the particle will resolve its position in that unlikely
outside bit of its posibility space that looks like the particle
teleporting out of the nucleus.

This is called Quantum Tunneling:

[[./teleporting_out_of_nucleus.jpg]]

When it's an alpha particle is escaping a nucleus this is one of the
most important mechanisms for radioactive decay.

Quantum tunneling also goes in the other direction.

Protons, neutrons, electrons and alpha particles can quantum tunnel
into nuclei in various types of fusion and particle capture phenomena.
Without it stars could not fuse hydrogen into heavy nuclei.

A variety of modern electronics also rely on the tunneling phenomenon,
including the transistor.

But how quickly the particle moves through this barrier?

As far as we know it's instantaneous. That suggests a velocity faster
tha light, which sounds problematic. It's actually extreamly hard to
test this because we can't make clocks accurate enough to time such a
ridiculously quick event.

The LEGO interferometer that discovered gravitational waves.
Laser beams are sent down paths at right angles and then brought back
together. The photon wave packets interact with each other and produce
an interference pattern that is incredibly sensitive to differences in
path lengths.

[[./interferometer.jpg]]

If we change the arangement of beam?
We want to send individual photons instead of lesers. And we want to
block one of the paths with a very thin reflective barrier.

In the absence of quantum tunneling that barrier should reflect its
photon 100% of the time. But just like with the alpha particle, as the
photon approaches the barrier the wave packet defining its possible
location extends weakly beyond the barrier. About 99% of the time the
photon is reflected. But 1% of the time it will resolve itself beyond
the barrier and it will continue onits path.

If those rare tunneling photons really do travel instantaneusly through
the width of the barrier, then they should arrive at the detector slightly
ahead of the photon that travels the unimpeded path.

That will be apparent when their wave packets don't line up.

For that to work you need to use a second, and perhaps even weirder
feature of quantum mechanics - quantum entanglement.
In order to produce these entangled states the path length of the
interferometer needs to be identical to very high precision.

Tune the path lengths until the weird effects of entanglement emerge,
and you know that they are equal. At that point, you can get an incredibly
precise measurement of any differences in photon travel time.

That experiment was already succesfully performed. They found the tunneling
photon does arrive a tiny bit earlier than its parther. It appears to
teleport through the barrier and so travel faster than light.

But this apparent violation of relativity only occurs deep within the
quantum realm.

A particle resolve its location anywhere within the vicinity of its
de Broglie wavelength. That uncertainty in location allows tunneling.
But even without barrier this location fuzziness leads to uncertainty in
the arrival time of the photon. An unimpeded photon could arrive at the
earlier time of the tunneling photon, because its wave packet includes 
that in its range of possible positions. When you add the barrier, all
you are realy doing is reshaping the wave packet, selecting only the
posibility space of earlier arrival. This can look like an increase in the
speed of light, but only within the uncertainty range defined by the
de Broglie wavelength. Between the uncertainty range defined by the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

\delta x \delta p >= h / 2

Which is from where the de Broglie wavelength comes.

Any microscopic object is subject to a very well-defined speed limit.
But in the quantum realm, Heisenberg uncertainty does seem to allow
instantaneous motion, and even perhaps causality violation within the
quantum limits.
