* Limits and Continuity

** ex.1: Limit

lim f(x) = 4
x->3

lim f(x) = 4
x->3-

lim f(x) = 4
x->3+

- the limit of f of x as x approaches 3 is 4
- the limit as we approach from the left is 4
- the limit as we aproach from the right is 4

** ex.2: Right and Left

lim f(x) = -4
x->3-

lim f(x) = 1
x->3+

- the function is discontinuos at x = 3,
- we have 2 limits from right and left, but
- the limit at x->3 does not exist

- the value of a function is not the same as the limit of the function
- we predict the limit by approximating infinitly close to the value,
but the value may be undefined, and the function can still have a limit,
- but if the value is infinity, we are infinitly approximating infinity
and in this case the limit does not exist from that direction


** ex.3: Continuity

*** Over a point
f is continuos when x=a if and only if

lim f(x) = f(a) 
x->a

*** Over an interval

f is cont. over (a,b) if and only if
f is cont. over every point in that interval

f is cont. over [a,b] if and only if

lim f(x) = f(a) and lim f(x) = f(b)
x->a+               x->b-

** Properties of Limits

lim f(x) = L    lim g(x) = M
x->a            x->a

lim( f(x) + g(x) ) = L + M     | Sum
x-> a

lim ( f(x) - g(x) ) = L - M    |  
x->a

lim ( f(x) * g(x) ) = L * M    | Product
x->a

lim ( f(x) / g(x) ) = L / M    | Difference

lim f(g(x)) = lim f( lim g(a) )| Composition
x->a


** Limits by substitution, factoring and rationalizing

ex.4:

f(x) = x^2 + x - 6 / x - 2 = (x + 3)(x - 2) / (x - 2) = x + 3 , x != 2

f(x) { x + 3     , x != 2
     { undefined , x = 2

lim f(x) = ?
x->2

ex.5:

lim x + 1/ sqrt(x + 5) - 2 = ?    | 0/0 
x-> -1

g(x) = x + 1/ sqrt(x + 5) - 2 =

= (x + 1 / sqrt(x + 5) - 2) * (sqrt(x + 5) + 2 / sqrt(x + 5) + 2) =

= (x + 1)(sqrt(x + 5) + 2) / x + 5 - 4 = sqrt(x + 5) + 2 , x != -1  

f(x) = sqrt(x + 5) + 2
f(x) = g(x) for all x != 1

lim g(x) = 4
x-> -1


(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2


** Limits of trigonometric functions

ex.6:

lim sin(x) = ? = sin(π) = 0
x-> π

sin and cos are defined for all real numbers and are continuos
over thier entire domain (tan and cot are also continuous), and
thier limit will be the value of the function at that point 


lim tan(x) = lim sin(x)/cos(x) = 0 / -1 = 0 
x-> π

lim cot(x) = lim cos(x)/sin(x) = 
x-> π

sin π = sin(π/2 + π/2) = cos π/2 = 0
sin(π) = 0
cos(0) = 1
cos(π) = -1
cos(π/2) = 0


Note: 0/0 is undetermined form -> the limit may still exist

** Trigonometry Review

*** Radians

Degrees seem to be historic artefact(coinsidance)
Radians are more rational(neutral, universal)

1 radian = 1 part of the circle with length equal to the radius
1 radian = 1 radius

How many radians in a 360deg(circle)?

c = 2πr
360 deg = c / r = 2πr / r = 2π radians
180 deg = π radians
1 deg   = π / 180
1 radian = 180 / π

*** Unit circle definitions of sin and cos

  Unit circle - a circle with radius 1

           (0,1)
           |  . (a,b) === (cos Theta, sin Theta)
           |. . b       
(-1,0) --------- (1,0)
           | a
           |
      (0,-1)

  We have a right angled triangle between the x and radius
  Theta is the angle between the x and radius

  soh cah toa - works well with triangles where the angle is
  less than 90 deg, but breaks on the circle

  sin Theta = Opposite/Hypotenuse = a / 1 = a

  cos Theta = Opposite/Hypotenuse = b / 1 = b

  The point (a,b) on the circle gives us the sin and cos of Theta
  
  
  tangens, cosecant, secant and cotangent:

  tan T = sin T / cos T = opposite / adjacent 
  
  csc T = 1 / sin T = hypotenuse / opposite = h / a

  sec T = 1 / cos T = hypothenuse / adjacent = h / b

  cot T = 1 / tan A = adjacent / opposite = b / a

  Some specieal values:

  sin 0  = 0
  sin 30 = 1/2
  sin 45 = sqrt(2)/2
  sin 60 = sqrt(3)/2
  sin 90 = 1

  Pytagorean identity

  cos^2(T) + sin^2(T) = 1

  Double angle identities:

  sin(2x) = 2 * sin(x) * cos(x)
  cos(2x) = cos^2(x) - sin^2(x)
          = 2 cos^2(x) - 1
          = 1 - 2sin^2(x)

  tan(2x) = 2tan(x) / 1 - tan^2(x)

  Power reducing identities:

  sin^2(x) = (1 - cos(2x)) / 2
  cos^2(x) = (1 + cos(2x)) / 2
  tan^2(x) = (1 - cos(2x)) / (1 + cos(2x))

*** Features of sinusoidal functions

    - midlane:
      
    - amplitude:
      how far does the function vary from the midline

    - period:
      how much to change x to go to the same point in the cycle

      
*** Tau or Pi

 π = c / d = c / 2r
 
 Eulers formula:

 e^iT = cos(T) + sin(T)

 Eulers identity:

 e^iπ + 1 = 0  
 
 Tau = c / r = 2π = 6.283185...

 C = Tau * r
 
 π/2 = Tau/4 radians

 e^iTau = cos(Tau) + i * sin(Tau) = 1 + 0 = 1

* Vectors and Spaces

** Vectors

   vector - has magnitude and direction

   5mph is just magnitude or scalar quontity
   5mph to each is a vector quontity called speed

   v = (5, 0) = [5, 0] = [5]
                         [0]

   R^2 is the real two-dimentional coordinate space 

   or all possible real-values 2-tuple
   a tuple is ordered list of values

   x = [0,0,0]
   b = [-1,5,3]

   x, b member of R^3
      
   R^n - n-dimentional real coordinate space

*** Sum of vectors:

   a = [6,-2], b = [-4,4]

   a + b = [6 + (-4), -2 + 4] = [2,2]

   Graphically they need to be aligned (put the tail of b at the head of a)
   into a triangle, (usualy at the base of the coord sys.) and the
   hypothenuse is the sum of the two vectors

*** Multiplying a vector by scalar 
   
   a = [2,1]
   3 * a = 3 * [2,1] = [6,3]
   -1 * a = [-2,-1] - it fliped to the opposite direction

*** The unit vector

    i = [1,0]  , x
    j = [0,1]  , y

    v = [2,3] = 2i + 3j

*** Parametric representation of lines

    v = [2,1]
    S = { c v | c member of R }
    - a set of colinear vectors

   Find the unit vector in the direction of u = (2,7)

   (2,7) / sqrt(2^2 + 7^2) = (2,7) / sqrt(53) =
   = ( 2/sqrt(53), 7/sqrt(53) )

   Find the component form of v + w:
   
   magnitude v = 3, angle = 30 deg
   (3, 30 deg)
   
   magnitude w = 6, angle = 340 deg
   (6, 340 deg)

   By constructing the right-angled triangle, we have
   the opposite = y*j, and the adjacent = x*i, where
   i and j are the unit vectors.

   From soh cah toa:
   
   sin(30) = x/3
   x = 3 * sin(30 deg) = 3 * 1/2 = 3/2

   cos(30) = y/3
   y = 3 * cos(30) = sqrt(3)/2

   Or more concise:
   
   v + w = (v_x + w_x, v_y + w_y)
   
   = (3 cos(30) + 6 cos(340)), (3 sin(30) + 6 sin(340))

 

** Linear combinations and spans

** Linear dependance and independance

** Subspaces and basis for a subspace

** Vector dot and cross products

   dot product

   a = (3, 1, 8)
   b = (4, 2, 3)

   The dot product of the ordered triple is:

   a * b = (3 * 4) + (1 * 2) + (8 * 3) = 38

   When multiplying matrices, it's useful to think of each
   matrix row and column as an n-tuple:

       c1 c2
   r1 [ 6  2 ]
   r2 [ 4  3 ]

   [ r1 * c1    r1 * c2 ]
   [ r2 * c1    r2 * c2 ]

   Matrix multiplication:

   [2 1] * [1 4]
   [5 2]   [3 6]

   = [ (2*1 + 1*3)   (2*4 + 1*6) ]
     [ (5*1 + 2*3)   (5*4 + 2*6) ]

   = [5    14]
     [11   32]

   Order matters when we multiply matrices.
   We can find the product only if the number of columns
   in the first matix is equal to the number of rows in
   the second matrix. The middle to numbers must be equal:

   rows x cols   rows x cols

   2 x 3   and   3 x 2    yes
   2 x 3   and   2 x 3    no
