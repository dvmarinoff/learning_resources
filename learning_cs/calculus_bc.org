* Limits and Continuity

** ex.1: Limit

lim f(x) = 4
x->3

lim f(x) = 4
x->3-

lim f(x) = 4
x->3+

- the limit of f of x as x approaches 3 is 4
- the limit as we approach from the left is 4
- the limit as we aproach from the right is 4

** ex.2: Right and Left

lim f(x) = -4
x->3-

lim f(x) = 1
x->3+

- the function is discontinuos at x = 3,
- we have 2 limits from right and left, but
- the limit at x->3 does not exist

- the value of a function is not the same as the limit of the function
- we predict the limit by approximating infinitly close to the value,
but the value may be undefined, and the function can still have a limit,
- but if the value is infinity, we are infinitly approximating infinity
and in this case the limit does not exist from that direction


** ex.3: Continuity

*** Over a point
f is continuos when x=a if and only if

lim f(x) = f(a) 
x->a

*** Over an interval

f is cont. over (a,b) if and only if
f is cont. over every point in that interval

f is cont. over [a,b] if and only if

lim f(x) = f(a) and lim f(x) = f(b)
x->a+               x->b-

** Properties of Limits

lim f(x) = L    lim g(x) = M
x->a            x->a

lim( f(x) + g(x) ) = L + M     | Sum
x-> a

lim ( f(x) - g(x) ) = L - M    |  
x->a

lim ( f(x) * g(x) ) = L * M    | Product
x->a

lim ( f(x) / g(x) ) = L / M    | Difference

lim f(g(x)) = lim f( lim g(a) )| Composition
x->a


** Limits by substitution, factoring and rationalizing

ex.4:

f(x) = x^2 + x - 6 / x - 2 = (x + 3)(x - 2) / (x - 2) = x + 3 , x != 2

f(x) { x + 3     , x != 2
     { undefined , x = 2

lim f(x) = ?
x->2

ex.5:

lim x + 1/ sqrt(x + 5) - 2 = ?    | 0/0 
x-> -1

g(x) = x + 1/ sqrt(x + 5) - 2 =

= (x + 1 / sqrt(x + 5) - 2) * (sqrt(x + 5) + 2 / sqrt(x + 5) + 2) =

= (x + 1)(sqrt(x + 5) + 2) / x + 5 - 4 = sqrt(x + 5) + 2 , x !0= -1  

f(x) = sqrt(x + 5) + 2
f(x) = g(x) for all x != 1

lim g(x) = 4
x-> -1


(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2


** Limits of trigonometric functions

ex.6:

lim sin(x) = ? = sin(π) = 0
x-> π

sin and cos are defined for all real numbers and are continuos
over thier entire domain (tan and cot are also continuous), and
thier limit will be the value of the function at that point 


lim tan(x) = lim sin(x)/cos(x) = 0 / -1 = 0 
x-> π

lim cot(x) = lim cos(x)/sin(x) = 
x-> π

sin π = sin(π/2 + π/2) = cos π/2 = 0
sin(π) = 0
cos(0) = 1
cos(π) = -1
cos(π/2) = 0


Note: 0/0 is undetermined form -> the limit may still exist


*** Squeeze theorem (Sandwich theorem)

Calories:
Imran <= Diya <= Sal

Tuesday: 1500 <= x <= 1500    -> x = 1500

The math vertion for functions

f(x) <= g(x) <= h(x)

lim f(x) = L    lim h(x) = L
x->a            x->a

-> lim g(x) = L
   x->a

*** lim sin(x)/x
    x-> 0      





* Derivatives

** Intro to derivatives

1) The 'instantanious' rate of change

2) Derivatives are about looking at tiny changes to some quontity
and how that relates to a resulting tiny change in another quontity
 
3) derivative is equal to the slope of a line tangent to the graph
at a single point

- avarage rate of change formula, slope

the slope of a curve is always changing at each point

f(b) - f(a) / b - a

- derivative 

f'(x) = \frac{df}{dx} = \lim_{x\to\0} = \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}

#+STARTUP: latexpreview
\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
#+STARTUP: nolatexpreview

- differentiability - does the function have a defined derivative at a point

if f is differentiable at x = a, then f is continuous x = a

f is not differebtiable if:
1) if f not continuous at x = a, then f is not differentiable
2) if f have vertical tangent at x= a f is not differentiable at x = 0
3) 'sharp turn' - as we approach the point from left or right slope of tangent is different
   
f(x) = abs(x) is not differentiable at the point of the 'sharp turn' 

- tangent line equation

to get slope of the tangent line at the point a (derivative):

\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}

to get tangent line equation (using the derivative):

f(x) = x^3
slope = 3
point = (-1,-1)

3 = y - (-1) / x - (-1)
y = 3x + 2

for
y = mx + b
where m is the slope and b is the y intercept
or

(y-y1) / (x - x1) = b
 
- Local linearity

The concept:
if we zoom enough on a non-linear function it will
start looking as a linear function

[[./img/local_linearity.jpg]]

Try that on:
y = x^1000
and zoom at the 'sharp turn', it will bein to look linear

Find approximation of the sqrt 4.36 without calculator?

$ \sqrt{4.36} = ? $

$ \sqrt{4} = 2 $

f(4) = 2
f(4.36) = ?

$ f(x) = \sqrt{x} = x^1/2 $

If we find the equation for the tangent line at f(4) we may approximate the f(4.36):

L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)*(x-a)

L(x) = f(4) + f'(4)*(x-4)

From Power rule:
f'(x) = 1/2 * x^-1/2
f'(4) = 1/4 

L(4.36) = f(4) + f'(4)*(4.36 - 4)
= 2 + 1/4 * 0.36 
= 2 + 0.09
= 2.09

$ 2.09^2 = 4,3681 $

$ \sqrt{4.36} = 2.088061 $

** Derivatives rules

*** Basic rules

1) Constant rule 

f(x) = k
-> f'(x) 0

2) Constant multiple rule

f(x) = k g(x)
-> f'(x) = k g'(x)

3) Sum rule
- of two functions

f(x) = g(x) + j(x)
-> f'(x) = g'(x) + j'(x)

*** Power rule

d/dx [x^n] = nx^n-1 , n != 0

NOTE:
derivative of x is 1x^0 = 1

*** Derivative of sin and cos

d/dx sin = cos

d/dx cos = -sin

*** Derivative of e^x and ln(x) 

d/dx [sin x] = cos x
d/dx [cos x] = -sin x
d/dx [tan x] = 1/cos^2(x) = sec^2(x)

d/dx [e^x] = e^x

slope of the tangent line at any point on e^x equals the value of e^x

d/dx [ln x] = 1/x = x^-1

fills the gap in the power rule

*** Product rule


d/dx[f(x) * g(x)] = f'(x)*g(x) + f(x)*g'(x)

*** Quotent rule

f(x) = u(x)/v(x)

f'(x) = u'(x)*v(x) - u(x)*v'(x) / [v(x)]^2

*** Chain Rule

the most common one, any time your function
can be used as composition of more than one funtions

h(x) = (sin x)^2 = sin^2(x)

h'(x) = dh/dx = 2sin(x) * cos(x)

from

a^2 = 2a
sin(x) = cos(x)

d/dx [f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) * g'(x) 

*** Log differentiation

d/dx [ln x] = 1/x

*** Trigonometric function differentiation

d/dx[tan(x)] = d/dx[sin(x)/cos(x)] = 1/cos^2(x) = sec^2(x)

d/dx[cot(x)] = d/dx[cos(x)/six(x)] = -1/sin^2(x) = -csc^2(x) 

d/dx[sec(x)] = d/dx[1/cos(x)] = sin(x)/cos^2(x) 

d/dx[csc(x)] = d/dx[1/sin(x)] = -cos(x)/sin^2(x)

*** Second derivatives

*** Implicit differentiation



* Existence theorems

if f(x) is continuoue over the closed interval [a,b]

*** Intermediate Value Theorem

'There exist a c that lies on L'

Suppose f is a function continuous at every point
of the interval [a,b]:

- f will take on every value between
 f(a) and f(b) over the interval

- For any L between the value f(a) and f(b),
 there exists a number c in [a,b] for which f(c) = L

*** Extream Value Theorem

'There exist values where the function takes a maximum and a minimum'

f cont. over [a,b] -> Exists absolute maximum and
absolute minimum value of f

*** Mean Value Theorem

'If also differeniable over the open interval (a,b)
There exists a pint c where the derivative of f(x)
(slope of the tangent line at that point) is the same
as the avarage rate of change'


NOTE: Differentiability implies continuity

* Using Derivatives to Analyze Functions

** L'Hopital's rule

\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = 0 and \lim_{x\to a} g(x) = 0 and \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = L 

Then:

\lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L

*** Radians

Degrees seem to be historic artefact(coinsidance)
Radians are more rational(neutral, universal)

1 radian = 1 part of the circle with length equal to the radius
1 radian = 1 radius

How many radians in a 360deg(circle)?

c = 2πr
360 deg = c / r = 2πr / r = 2π radians
180 deg = π radians
1 deg   = π / 180
1 radian = 180 / π

*** Unit circle definitions of sin and cos

  Unit circle - a circle with radius 1

           (0,1)
           |  . (a,b) === (cos Theta, sin Theta)
           |. . b       
(-1,0) --------- (1,0)
           | a
           |
      (0,-1)

  We have a right angled triangle between the x and radius
  Theta is the angle between the x and radius

  soh cah toa - works well with triangles where the angle is
  less than 90 deg, but breaks on the circle

  sin Theta = Opposite/Hypotenuse = a / 1 = a

  cos Theta = Opposite/Hypotenuse = b / 1 = b

  The point (a,b) on the circle gives us the sin and cos of Theta
  
  
  tangens, cosecant, secant and cotangent:

  tan T = sin T / cos T = opposite / adjacent 
  
  csc T = 1 / sin T = hypotenuse / opposite = h / a

  sec T = 1 / cos T = hypothenuse / adjacent = h / b

  cot T = 1 / tan A = adjacent / opposite = b / a

  Some specieal values:

  sin 0  = 0
  sin 30 = 1/2
  sin 45 = sqrt(2)/2
  sin 60 = sqrt(3)/2
  sin 90 = 1

|   T  | sin T | cos T | 
|------+-------+-------|
|  0   |   0   |   1   |
| π/2  |   1   |   0   |
|  π   |   0   |  -1   |
| 3π/2 |  -1   |   0   |
|  2π  |   0   |   1   |

  Pytagorean identity

  cos^2(T) + sin^2(T) = 1

  Double angle identities:

  sin(2x) = 2 * sin(x) * cos(x)
  cos(2x) = cos^2(x) - sin^2(x)
          = 2 cos^2(x) - 1
          = 1 - 2sin^2(x)

  tan(2x) = 2tan(x) / 1 - tan^2(x)

  Power reducing identities:

  sin^2(x) = (1 - cos(2x)) / 2
  cos^2(x) = (1 + cos(2x)) / 2
  tan^2(x) = (1 - cos(2x)) / (1 + cos(2x))

*** Features of sinusoidal functions

    - midlane:
      
    - amplitude:
      how far does the function vary from the midline

    - period:
      how much to change x to go to the same point in the cycle
 
*** Tau or Pi

 π = c / d = c / 2r
 
 Eulers formula:

 e^iT = cos(T) + sin(T)

 Eulers identity:

 e^iπ + 1 = 0  
 
 Tau = c / r = 2π = 6.283185...

 C = Tau * r
 
 π/2 = Tau/4 radians

 e^iTau = cos(Tau) + i * sin(Tau) = 1 + 0 = 1

** Hyperbolic Trig functions

cosh x = e^x + e^-x / 2

sinh x = e^x - e^-x / 2

* Algebra

** Properties of exponents

x^n * x^m = x^n+m

x^n/x^m   = x^n-m

(x^n)^m   = x^n*m

(x * y)^n = x^n * y^n

(x/y)^n   = x^n/y^n

1/(x^n)   = 1 * x^-n

x^(3/4)   = x^(1/4)^3

** Properties of logarithms

ln a/b = ln a - ln b


* Linear Algebra

** Vectors

   vector - has magnitude and direction

   5mph is just magnitude or scalar quontity
   5mph to each is a vector quontity called speed

   v = (5, 0) = [5, 0] = [5]
                         [0]

   R^2 is the real two-dimentional coordinate space 

   or all possible real-values 2-tuple
   a tuple is ordered list of values

   x = [0,0,0]
   b = [-1,5,3]

   x, b member of R^3
      
   R^n - n-dimentional real coordinate space

*** Sum of vectors:

   a = [6,-2], b = [-4,4]

   a + b = [6 + (-4), -2 + 4] = [2,2]

   Graphically they need to be aligned (put the tail of b at the head of a)
   into a triangle, (usualy at the base of the coord sys.) and the
   hypothenuse is the sum of the two vectors

*** Multiplying a vector by scalar 
   
   a = [2,1]
   3 * a = 3 * [2,1] = [6,3]
   -1 * a = [-2,-1] - it fliped to the opposite direction

*** The unit vector

    i = [1,0]  , x
    j = [0,1]  , y

    v = [2,3] = 2i + 3j

*** Parametric representation of lines

    v = [2,1]
    S = { c v | c member of R }
    - a set of colinear vectors

   Find the unit vector in the direction of u = (2,7)

   (2,7) / sqrt(2^2 + 7^2) = (2,7) / sqrt(53) =
   = ( 2/sqrt(53), 7/sqrt(53) )

   Find the component form of v + w:
   
   magnitude v = 3, angle = 30 deg
   (3, 30 deg)
   
   magnitude w = 6, angle = 340 deg
   (6, 340 deg)

   By constructing the right-angled triangle, we have
   the opposite = y*j, and the adjacent = x*i, where
   i and j are the unit vectors.

   From soh cah toa:
   
   sin(30) = x/3
   x = 3 * sin(30 deg) = 3 * 1/2 = 3/2

   cos(30) = y/3
   y = 3 * cos(30) = sqrt(3)/2

   Or more concise:
   
   v + w = (v_x + w_x, v_y + w_y)
   
   = (3 cos(30) + 6 cos(340)), (3 sin(30) + 6 sin(340))

*** Vector dot and cross products

   dot product

   a = (3, 1, 8)
   b = (4, 2, 3)

   The dot product of the ordered triple is:

   a * b = (3 * 4) + (1 * 2) + (8 * 3) = 38

   When multiplying matrices, it's useful to think of each
   matrix row and column as an n-tuple:

       c1 c2
   r1 [ 6  2 ]
   r2 [ 4  3 ]

   [ r1 * c1    r1 * c2 ]
   [ r2 * c1    r2 * c2 ]

** Matrices

*** Matrix multiplication:

   [2 1] * [1 4]
   [5 2]   [3 6]

   = [ (2*1 + 1*3)   (2*4 + 1*6) ]
     [ (5*1 + 2*3)   (5*4 + 2*6) ]

   = [5    14]
     [11   32]


   by finding dot products of rows from left and cols from right:

   1st row times 1st col     1st row times 2nd col
   2nd row times 1st col     2nd row times 2nd col


   - commutative property of multiplication does not hold
     order matters when we multiply matrices

     A * B != B * A

   - result is not always defined

   We can find the product only if the number of columns
   in the first matix is equal to the number of rows in
   the second matrix. The middle to numbers must be equal:

   rows x cols   rows x cols

   2 x 3   and   3 x 2    yes
   2 x 3   and   2 x 3    no

*** Identity matrix 

    1 * x = x   <- identity

    I * A = A

    A = [1 2 3]
        [4 5 6]
        [7 8 9]

    [1 0 0]       [1 2 3]
    [0 1 0] x A = [4 5 6]
    [0 0 1]       [7 8 9]       
                  
   - Multiplicative Inverses

     1/3 * 3 = 1
     3 * 1/3 = 1
    
     All nonzero real numbers have one, but
     not all matrices have multiplicative inverses

   - Dimensions of identity matrix

     It is always going to be square.
     From:

     I    x     A      =    A
     ? x ?      a x b       a x b
     a x a

     - Cols of 1st = Rows of 2nd
     - Rows of product = rows of 1st

Count the number of scenarios/permutations?

Permutations: 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120

But what if we have just 3 chairs?

5 4 3
_ _ _
1 2 3

5*4*3 = 60 = 5*4*3*2*1 / 2*1 = 5! / 2! = 5! / (5 - 3)!

Permutations of n people and r chairs:

P(n,r) , n P r = n! / (n - r)!

Don't try to memorize. Always reason it through

*** Zero factorial

0! != 0, but

0! = 1

*** Combinations Formula

A B C D E F

6 5 4 3
_ _ _ _
1 2 3 4 

P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)!

1) A B C D   are 2 of the 360 permutaions, 
2) D A B C   but just one combination of people

number of ways to arrange k things in k spots = k!

C(n, k) = (n! / (n - k)!) / k! = n! / k!(n -k!)
