* Limits and Continuity

** ex.1: Limit

lim f(x) = 4
x->3

lim f(x) = 4
x->3-

lim f(x) = 4
x->3+

- the limit of f of x as x approaches 3 is 4
- the limit as we approach from the left is 4
- the limit as we aproach from the right is 4

** ex.2: Right and Left

lim f(x) = -4
x->3-

lim f(x) = 1
x->3+

- the function is discontinuos at x = 3,
- we have 2 limits from right and left, but
- the limit at x->3 does not exist

- the value of a function is not the same as the limit of the function
- we predict the limit by approximating infinitly close to the value,
but the value may be undefined, and the function can still have a limit,
- but if the value is infinity, we are infinitly approximating infinity
and in this case the limit does not exist from that direction


** ex.3: Continuity

*** Over a point
f is continuos when x=a if and only if

lim f(x) = f(a) 
x->a

*** Over an interval

f is cont. over (a,b) if and only if
f is cont. over every point in that interval

f is cont. over [a,b] if and only if

lim f(x) = f(a) and lim f(x) = f(b)
x->a+               x->b-

** Properties of Limits

lim f(x) = L    lim g(x) = M
x->a            x->a

lim( f(x) + g(x) ) = L + M     | Sum
x-> a

lim ( f(x) - g(x) ) = L - M    |  
x->a

lim ( f(x) * g(x) ) = L * M    | Product
x->a

lim ( f(x) / g(x) ) = L / M    | Difference

lim f(g(x)) = lim f( lim g(a) )| Composition
x->a
