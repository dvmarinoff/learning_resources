* Limits and Continuity

** ex.1: Limit

lim f(x) = 4
x->3

lim f(x) = 4
x->3-

lim f(x) = 4
x->3+

- the limit of f of x as x approaches 3 is 4
- the limit as we approach from the left is 4
- the limit as we aproach from the right is 4

** ex.2: Right and Left

lim f(x) = -4
x->3-

lim f(x) = 1
x->3+

- the function is discontinuos at x = 3,
- we have 2 limits from right and left, but
- the limit at x->3 does not exist

- the value of a function is not the same as the limit of the function
- we predict the limit by approximating infinitly close to the value,
but the value may be undefined, and the function can still have a limit,
- but if the value is infinity, we are infinitly approximating infinity
and in this case the limit does not exist from that direction


** ex.3: Continuity

*** Over a point
f is continuos when x=a if and only if

lim f(x) = f(a)
x->a

*** Over an interval

f is cont. over (a,b) if and only if
f is cont. over every point in that interval

f is cont. over [a,b] if and only if

lim f(x) = f(a) and lim f(x) = f(b)
x->a+               x->b-

** Properties of Limits

lim f(x) = L    lim g(x) = M
x->a            x->a

lim( f(x) + g(x) ) = L + M     | Sum
x-> a

lim ( f(x) - g(x) ) = L - M    |
x->a

lim ( f(x) * g(x) ) = L * M    | Product
x->a

lim ( f(x) / g(x) ) = L / M    | Difference

lim f(g(x)) = lim f( lim g(a) )| Composition
x->a


** Limits by substitution, factoring and rationalizing

ex.4:

f(x) = x^2 + x - 6 / x - 2 = (x + 3)(x - 2) / (x - 2) = x + 3 , x != 2

f(x) { x + 3     , x != 2
     { undefined , x = 2

lim f(x) = ?
x->2

ex.5:

lim x + 1/ sqrt(x + 5) - 2 = ?    | 0/0
x-> -1

g(x) = x + 1/ sqrt(x + 5) - 2 =

= (x + 1 / sqrt(x + 5) - 2) * (sqrt(x + 5) + 2 / sqrt(x + 5) + 2) =

= (x + 1)(sqrt(x + 5) + 2) / x + 5 - 4 = sqrt(x + 5) + 2 , x !0= -1

f(x) = sqrt(x + 5) + 2
f(x) = g(x) for all x != 1

lim g(x) = 4
x-> -1


(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2


** Limits of trigonometric functions

ex.6:

lim sin(x) = ? = sin(π) = 0
x-> π

sin and cos are defined BG
for all reaBBG
G
l numbers and are continuos
over thier entire domain (tan and cot are also continuous), and
thier limit will be the value of the function at that point


lim tan(x) = lim sin(x)/cos(x) = 0 / -1 = 0
x-> π

lim cot(x) = lim cos(x)/sin(x) =
x-> π

sin π = sin(π/2 + π/2) = cos π/2 = 0
sin(π) = 0
cos(0) = 1
cos(π) = -1
cos(π/2) = 0


Note: 0/0 is undetermined form -> the limit may still exist


*** Squeeze theorem (Sandwich theorem)

Calories:
Imran <= Diya <= Sal

Tuesday: 1500 <= x <= 1500    -> x = 1500

The math vertion for functions

f(x) <= g(x) <= h(x)

lim f(x) = L    lim h(x) = L
x->a            x->a

-> lim g(x) = L
   x->a

*** lim sin(x)/x
    x-> 0





* Derivatives

** Intro to derivatives

1) The 'instantanious' rate of change

2) Derivatives arBG
e about looking at tiny changes to some quontity
and how that relates to a resulting tiny change in another quontity

3) derivative is equal to the slope of a line tangent to the graph
at a single point

- avarage rate of change formula, slope

the slope of a curve is always changing at each point

f(b) - f(a) / b - a

- derivative

f'(x) = \frac{df}{dx} = \lim_{x\to\0} = \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}

#+STARTUP: latexpreview
\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
#+STARTUP: nolatexpreview

- differentiability - does the function have a defined derivative at a point

if f is differentiable at x = a, then f is continuous x = a

f is not differebtiable if:
1) if f not continuous at x = a, then f is not differentiable
2) if f have vertical tangent at x= a f is not differentiable at x = 0
3) 'sharp turn' - as we approach the point from left or right slope of tangent is different

f(x) = abs(x) is not differentiable at the point of the 'sharp turn'

- tangent line equation

to get slope of the tangent line at the point a (derivative):

\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}

to get tangent line equation (using the derivative):

f(x) = x^3
slope = 3
point = (-1,-1)

3 = y - (-1) / x - (-1)
y = 3x + 2

for
y = mx + b
where m is the slope and b is the y intercept
or

(y-y1) / (x - x1) = b

- Local linearity

The concept:
if we zoom enough on a non-linear function it will
start looking as a linear function

[[./img/local_linearity.jpg]]

Try that on:
y = x^1000
and zoom at the 'sharp turn', it will bein to look linear

Find approximation of the sqrt 4.36 without calculator?

$ \sqrt{4.36} = ? $

$ \sqrt{4} = 2 $

f(4) = 2
f(4.36) = ?

$ f(x) = \sqrt{x} = x^1/2 $

If we find the equation for the tangent line at f(4) we may approximate the f(4.36):

L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)*(x-a)

L(x) = f(4) + f'(4)*(x-4)

From Power rule:
f'(x) = 1/2 * x^-1/2
f'(4) = 1/4

L(4.36) = f(4) + f'(4)*(4.36 - 4)
= 2 + 1/4 * 0.36
= 2 + 0.09
= 2.09

$ 2.09^2 = 4,3681 $

$ \sqrt{4.36} = 2.088061 $

** Derivatives rules

*** Basic rules

1) Constant rule

f(x) = k
-> f'(x) 0

2) Constant multiple rule

f(x) = k g(x)
-> f'(x) = k g'(x)

3) Sum rule
- of two functions

f(x) = g(x) + j(x)
-> f'(x) = g'(x) + j'(x)

*** Power rule

d/dx [x^n] = nx^n-1 , n != 0

NOTE:
derivative of x is 1x^0 = 1

*** Derivative of sin and cos

d/dx sin = cos

d/dx cos = -sin

*** Derivative of e^x and ln(x)

d/dx [sin x] = cos x
d/dx [cos x] = -sin x
d/dx [tan x] = 1/cos^2(x) = sec^2(x)

d/dx [e^x] = e^x

slope of the tangent line at any point on e^x equals the value of e^x

d/dx [ln x] = 1/x = x^-1

fills the gap in the power rule

d/dx [ln(4x)] = 4/4x

*** Product rule


d/dx[f(x) * g(x)] = f'(x)*g(x) + f(x)*g'(x)

*** Quotent rule

f(x) = u(x)/v(x)

f'(x) = u'(x)*v(x) - u(x)*v'(x) / [v(x)]^2

*** Chain Rule

the most common one, any time your function
can be used as composition of more than one funtions

h(x) = (sin x)^2 = sin^2(x)

h'(x) = dh/dx = 2sin(x) * cos(x)

from

a^2 = 2a
sin(x) = cos(x)

d/dx [f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)

d/dx [f(g(h(x)))] = f'( g(h(x)) ) * g'(x) * h'(x)

Ex.:

d/dx [sin(ln(x^2))] = ?

f(x) = sin(x)  f'(x) = cos(x)
g(x) = ln(x)   g'(x) = 1/x
h(x) = x^2     h'(x) = 2x

cos(ln(x^2)) * 1/x^2 * 2x
= 2/x * cos(ln(x^2))

*** Log differentiation

d/dx [ln x] = 1/x

d/dx [log_a(x)] = 1 / (ln a) * x

Remember that:

log_a(b) = log_d(a) / log_d(b)

d/dx [log_4(x)] = 1 / (ln 4) * x


Ex:

d/dx [sin(ln(x^2))] = ?

f(x) = sin(x)
g(x) = ln(x)
h(x) = x^2

= cos(ln(x^2) * 1/x * 2x
= 2 * cos(ln(x^2))

*** Trigonometric function differentiation

d/dx[tan(x)] = d/dx[sin(x)/cos(x)] = 1/cos^2(x) = sec^2(x)

d/dx[cot(x)] = d/dx[cos(x)/six(x)] = -1/sin^2(x) = -csc^2(x)

d/dx[sec(x)] = d/dx[1/cos(x)] = sin(x)/cos^2(x)

d/dx[csc(x)] = d/dx[1/sin(x)] = -cos(x)/sin^2(x)

*** Second derivatives

*** Implicit differentiation


*** Parametric functions



* Existence theorems

if f(x) is continuous over the closed interval [a,b]

*** Intermediate Value Theorem

'There exist a c that lies on L'

Suppose f is a function continuous at every point
of the interval [a,b]:

- f will take on every value between
 f(a) and f(b) over the interval

- For any L between the value f(a) and f(b),
 there exists a number c in [a,b] for which f(c) = L

*** Extream Value Theorem

'There exist values where the function takes a maximum and a minimum'

f cont. over [a,b] -> Exists absolute maximum and
absolute minimum value of f

*** Mean Value Theorem

'If also differeniable over the open interval (a,b)
There exists a pint c where the derivative of f(x)
(slope of the tangent line at that point) is the same
as the avarage rate of change'


NOTE: Differentiability implies continuity

[[./img/existence_theorems_intro.jpg]]


* Using Derivatives to Analyze Functions

** L'Hopital's rule

Using derivatives to take limits
Useful in special case of undetermined form:

{0}/{0}

\infty/\infty

-\infty/\infty



\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = 0

and

\lim_{x\to a} g(x) = 0

and

\lim_{x\to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = L

Then:

\lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L

[[./img/l'hopital's_rule.jpg]]

** Minimun and Maximum

f(c) is a relative maximum
if f(c) >= f(x)
for All x member of (c - h, c + h) for h > 0

f(d) is a relative minimum
if f(d) <= f(x)
for All x member of (d - h, d + h) for h > 0

** Analyzing a function with its derivative

When f'(x) is below the x axis f(x) is decreasing

Example:

f(x) = x^3 - 12x + 2
f'(x) = 3x^2 -12

3x^2 - 12 = 0
x^2 = 4
->
x = 2, x = -2

f'(2) = 0, f'(-2) = 0

so f(x) has critical points at x = 2 and x = -2

[[./img/analyzing_function_with_its_derivative.jpg]]

** Critical points

non endpoint, min or max at x = a ->
f'(a) = 0
f'(a) = undefined

but not when the function is also undefined at that point


Example: Finding critical points of a function

f(x) = xe^(-2x^2)

From product and chain rule:

f'(x) = d/dx[x]e^(-2x^2) + d/dx[e^(-2x^2)]x

= 1e^(-2x^2) + e^(-2x^2)*(-4x)*x

= e^(-2x^2) * (1 - 4x^2)

we can get it equal to 0 only when (1 - 4x^2) is equal to 0

1 - 4x^2 = 0
x^2 = 1/4
x = 1/2, x = -1/2

critical points are at 1/2 and -1/2



Example: Finding decreasing interval

f(x) = x^6 - 3x^5

f'(x) = 6x^5 - 15x^4

6x^5 - 15x^4 < 0

3x^4(2x - 5) < 0

(3x^4 < 0 AND 2x - 5 > 0) OR (3x^4 > 0 AND 2x - 5 < 0)

x^4 < 0 will never be less than 0 and x != 0

2x - 5 < 0

x < 5/2

-> the decreasing interval is

x < 0 OR x 0 > x < 5/2



Example: Finding inceasing interval

g'(x) = x^2 / (x - 2)^3


x^2 / (x - 2)^3 > 0

(x - 2)^3 > 0

x > 2

(2, \inf)


*** Practice:
Find critical points of:
01. g(x) = x^3 + x^2 + x
g'(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1
3x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0
3x(x + 2/3) = -1

It is never undefined or 0
No critical points

02. h(x) = sqrt(x^2 + 4)
h'(x) = 1/2(x^2 + 4)^-1/2 * 2x

x = 0 undifined

03. h(x) = e^(2x-6) - e
h'(x) = e^(2x-6) * d/dx[2x - 6]
= 2 * e^(2x-6)

2e^(2x-6) = 0 has no solutions and is never undefined
No critical points

04. h(x) = 4x^2 / x^2 - 1
h'(x) = (8x * (x^2 - 1)) - (2x * (4x^2)) / (x^2 -1)^2
= 8x^3 - 8x - 8x^3 / x^4 + 1
= -8x / x^4 + 1

x = 0 is undefined

05. f(x) = 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x
f'(x) = 6x^2 - 18x + 12
6x^2 - 18x + 12 = 0
6x(x - 3 + 12/6x) = 0
or
6(x - 1)(x - 2) = 0

x = 1 and x = 2

06. h(x) = e^(2x) / x - 3
h'(x) = 2e^(2x) * (x - 3) - e^(2x) / (x - 3)^2
= -7e^(2x) + 2x*e^2x = e^(2x)*(2x - 7)

x = 7/2 is equal to 0
x = -3 is undefind, but also h(x) is undefined so it is not a critical point

07.

** Finding relative extrema

Relative maximum
When does g' go from g'>0 to g'<0 (from positive to negative value)

Example: Find revalive extrema of g(x) = x^4 - x^5
g'(x) = 0 when

4x^3 - 5x^4 = 0
x^3(4 - 5x) = 0

x^3 = 0, x = 4/5 are critical points

g'(x) = undefined when
never

Analyze values (graph) of the derivative:

| interval   | value          | direction |
|------------+----------------+-----------|
| (-\inf, 0) | g'(-1) = -9    | dec       |
| (0, 1)     | g'(1/2) = 3/16 | inc       |
| (1, \inf)  | g'(1) = -1     | dec       |

Note:
it may be the case that derivative is 0, but that critical
point is not an extremum. For example when the value (graph)
is positive goes to 0 then back to being positive

|graph            | local exremum |
|-----------------+---------------|
| pos -> 0 -> neg | maximum       |
| neg -> 0 -> pos | minimum       |
| pos -> 0 -> pos | false         |
| neg -> 0 -> neg | false         |


[[./img/critical_point_intro.jpg]]

** Concavity

upwards concavity
downwards concavity

[[./img/concavity_intro.jpg]]

** Inflection points

An inflection point is a point on a graph where the slope goes from
decreasing to increasing, or from increasing to decreasing.
Point where we change concavity.

You can get them from first derivatives:

When f'(x) crosses the x-axis it is a min or max point for f(x)
When f'(x) reaches a min or max point it is an inflection point for f(x)

You can get them from second derivatives:

When f''(x) crosses the x-axis

| f''                             | f'                                 | f                                    |
|---------------------------------+------------------------------------+--------------------------------------|
| positive +                      | increasing up                      | concave up                           |
| negative -                      | decreasing down                    | concave down                         |
| crossing x-axis (changing sign) | extremum point (changes direction) | inflection point (changes concavity) |

*** Second derivative test

If you have:
h(8) = 5
h'(8) = 0
h''(8) = -4

Is (8,5) on f(x) a relative minimum, maximum point or
there is not enough information?

[[./img/second_derivative_test.jpg]]


** Finding Inflection points and Analyzing Concavity

Example:
Let g(x) = -x^4 +6x^2 - 2x - 3.
Find intervals where g(x) is concave upwards or downwards?

g'(x) = -4x^3 + 12x - 2

g''(x) = -12x^2 + 12

-12x^2 + 12 = 0
x^2 = 1
x = 1
x = -1

g''(-2) = -36   (-\inf, -1)   down

g''(0) = 12     (-1, 1)       up

g''(2) = -36    (1, \inf)     down



Example:
Let g(x) = 1/4x^4 - 4x^3 + 24x^2.
For what values of x does the graph of g have an inflection point?

g'(x) = 1x^3 - 12x^2 + 48x

g''(x) = 3x^2 - 24x + 48

3x^2 - 24x + 48 = 0
x = 4

But
f''(0) = 48    (0, 4)    pos

f''(4) = 0     0         0

f''(10) = 108  (4, 108)  pos

->

There is no inflection point

NOTE:
Remember to check for candidates
Remember that there might be inflection point on undefined values
Remember to check that f''(x) is actually crossing the x-axis

These functions can be visualized in just 2 dimentions, where we
visualize the entire input space in associated color with each point.

If we have f(x, y) = x^2 ... , the color tells us the size of the
output, and the lines, called contour lines, tell us which inputs
all share a constant output value.

Surfaces in 3d space are mapping 2d input that moves into 3d
(Parametric surfaces).

Vector field is where every input point is associated with some kind
of vector which is the output of the function there.

In this case 2d input to 2d vector.

[[./img/vector_field.jpg]]

And also understanding functions as transformations of space is a
great way to connect multivariable calculus with linear algebra.

There is a huge value in analogy between 2d and 3d, beacause as soon as
you start to compare 2d and 3d, you start to see patterns for how it
could extend to other dimensions that you can't neccessarily visualize.

Every point in 2d space can be given a pair of numbers like (1, 3) that
serve as instructions. Also you can think of the reverse. Every time
that you have a pair of things you know that you should be thinking 2d.
In 3d there is a similar dichotomy between triplets of things and
points in 3d space. Same thing for vectors.

3d graphs:

f(x) = x^2
output is parabola

f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2
inputs live on tha x, y plane
output is a surface that look like 3d parabola

if we modify the function to:
f(x, y) = 1/2(x^2+ y^2)
the hight of every poit will be cut in half

Interpreting graphs with slices:

f(x, y) = cos(x)sin(y)

the graph is a bumpy 3d wave like surface.
If will take x = 0 we have a slice with a plane that sits on the x origin
If we cut the graph along that plane and draw a line over that spot
we get a line that looks like the sinosuidal wave.

If x = 0:
f(0, y) = cos(0)sin(y) = 1*sin(y)
and we are left only with the sin(y) function

If y = 0:
f(x, 0) = cos(y) * sin(0) = 0
everything looks like a constant function at 0, just a line along the x.

If y = \pi / 2
f(x, \pi/2) = cos(x)sin(\pi/2) = cos(x) * 1
looks like the graph of cos(x)

Contour plots:

The idea is that we take a nd graph slice it with planes that are all
parallel to the x, y plane and represent values of z like:
z = -1, z = -2, z = 0, z = 1, z = 2
Now we draw the lines where this planes touch the surface of the graph
and squish them down flat on to the x, y plane. Now we have something
2d that still represents some of the outputs of our function.

Small step between lines means steepness, larger distances between lines
are much more shallow.

In the coloring warmer colors are high values while cooler colors are
lower values.

Parametric curves:

Consider: f(t) = [tcos(t) tsin(t)]
1 parameter functions that output 2d vector
parameter is fancy for input

f(0) = [0 0]
f(\pi/2) = [0 \pi/2]

We get a spiral pattern.

Parametric surfaces:

f(t,s) = [3cos(t) + cos(t)cos(t), 3sin(t) + sin(t)cos(t), sin(s)]

2d input to 3d output

f(0, \pi) = [2, 0, 0]

Suppose ew keep s to be a constant value and let t vary freely.
In this case we get a circle surface on the x, y.

If we do the opposite and keep just t a constant, we get another
circle surface on the z axis.

If we let them both run freely we get the z axis circle to becaome a 3d
surface circumventing the x, y surface. End result is a torus(doughnut).

Vector fields:

come up all the time in physics, fluid flow, electrodynamics.
It is a way of visualizing a function that hace the same number of
dimentions in their input as in their outpus.

f(x, y) = [y^3 - 9y, x^ - 9x]

You have 2d in input and 2d in output so it must be in 4d.
Instead we can look only the input.

** Radians

Degrees seem to be historic artefact(coinsidance)
Radians are more rational(neutral, universal)

1 radian = 1 part of the circle with length equal to the radius
1 radian = 1 radius

How many radians in a 360deg(circle)?

c = 2πr
360 deg = c / r = 2πr / r = 2π radians
180 deg = π radians
1 deg   = π / 180
1 radian = 180 / π

** Unit circle definitions of sin and cos

  Unit circle - a circle with radius

[[./img/unit_circle.jpg]]

  We have a right angled triangle between the x and radius
  Theta is the angle between the x and radius

  soh cah toa - works well with triangles where the angle is
  less than 90 deg, but breaks on the circle

  sin Theta = Opposite/Hypotenuse = a / 1 = a

  cos Theta = Opposite/Hypotenuse = b / 1 = b

  The point (a,b) on the circle gives us the sin and cos of Theta


  tangens, cosecant, secant and cotangent:

  tan T = sin T / cos T = opposite / adjacent

  csc T = 1 / sin T = hypotenuse / opposite = h / a

  sec T = 1 / cos T = hypothenuse / adjacent = h / b

  cot T = 1 / tan A = adjacent / opposite = b / a

  Some specieal values:

  sin 0  = 0
  sin 30 = 1/2
  sin 45 = sqrt(2)/2
  sin 60 = sqrt(3)/2
  sin 90 = 1

|   T  | sin T | cos T |
|------+-------+-------|
|  0   |   0   |   1   |
| π/2  |   1   |   0   |
|  π   |   0   |  -1   |
| 3π/2 |  -1   |   0   |
|  2π  |   0   |   1   |

  Pytagorean identity

  cos^2(T) + sin^2(T) = 1

  Double angle identities:

  sin(2x) = 2 * sin(x) * cos(x)
  cos(2x) = cos^2(x) - sin^2(x)
          = 2 cos^2(x) - 1
          = 1 - 2sin^2(x)

  tan(2x) = 2tan(x) / 1 - tan^2(x)

  Power reducing identities:

  sin^2(x) = (1 - cos(2x)) / 2
  cos^2(x) = (1 + cos(2x)) / 2
  tan^2(x) = (1 - cos(2x)) / (1 + cos(2x))

*** Features of sinusoidal functions

    - midlane:

    - amplitude:
      how far does the function vary from the midline

    - period:
      how much to change x to go to the same point in the cycle

*** Tau or Pi

 π = c / d = c / 2r

 Eulers formula:

 e^iT = cos(T) + sin(T)

 Eulers identity:

 e^iπ + 1 = 0

 Tau = c / r = 2π = 6.283185...

 C = Tau * r

 π/2 = Tau/4 radians

 e^iTau = cos(Tau) + i * sin(Tau) = 1 + 0 = 1
