** Intro
*** Current

The story of current starts with the idea of charges, positive and negative
charge. If they are opposite sign there will be force of attraction between
them, or else repel them.

- +

< + + >

- > < +

We can get charge from copper and copper wires.

Cu 29 (29 protons inside and 29 electrons outside)

The last orbit has just one electron in it and it is easiest to pull away
and have it go participate in conduction (electric current).

e-

Silver has the same kind of electron configuration.

If we hook up a source of voltage (battery) to a copper wire, all the loose
last orbit electron will start moving in the direction of the + source on
the battery and at the end an electron will come out the - side of the
battery and make up the difference.

But how do we measure what is heppaning?

count how many e- are passing through a cut in the wire for a second.

Current is reported as the number of charges per unit time passing through
a boundary.

Current i = charge-/sec

What is the direction of Current?

positive current direction is opposite to the electron flow

negative current direction is the direction of the electron flow

Ben Franklin make the decision that the positive current is the direction
of current (nobody knew anything about electrons back then).

Note:
Electron is discovered by J.J.Thompson in 1897

Conventional Current is this positive direction current.

*** Voltage

Intuition:

As idea it is very similar to Gravity.

If you have a large body of mass on the slopes of a mountain, the potential
energy it has is going to be dissipated as kinetic energy and it is going to
roll down the hill.

We can think as voltage being a moutain top and battery delivering e- to the
top and if you release it it goes through all kinds of capacitors, resistors
etc. to the + bottom. High mountain high voltage.

We disign circuits by putting stuff in the way of the electron current

** Circuit Analysis
*** Ideal Circuit Elemements

Resistor R

v = i * R, also known as Ohm's Law

Capacitor C

i = C dv/dt
C is proportionality canstant

Inductor L

v = L di/dt 
L proportionality constant is the inductance of the inductor,
time rate of change of current flowing through the inductor
