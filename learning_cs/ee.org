** Silicon (Silizium)

1808 named by Sir Humphry Davy

from latin silix, silicis for flint and -ium for metal

1823 Jons Jocob Berzelius prepared amorohous silicon and is usually given
credit for discovering the element

Si 
group: 14(carbon group), periodi: 3, Z=14 
atomic radius: 111 pm (pico meters 1*10^-12) 
Van der Waals radius: 210 pm
electron configuration: [Ne]3s^2 3p^2
electrons per shell: 2, 8, 4

8 most common in universe by mass
2 most common in the Earth's crust,
but rarely occurs as pure element, mostly as silicon dioxide(silica)

Used in steel refining, aluminium-casting, fine chemical industries, and small
portion of very highly purified silicon is essential to integrated circuits.


Monocrystaline silicon is used to produce silicon wafers and silicon oxide is
used as an insulator both in integrated circuits.

Polycrystaline silicon is used in photovoltaic

It is exelant semiconductor, can withstand highest temperatures and greatest
electrical activity without suffering avalanche breakdown(an electron avalanche
is created when heat produces free electron holes, which in turn pass more
current, which produces more heat). In addition the insulating silicon oxide is
easy to produce and is not soluble in water, which gives it great advantage
over other elements as germanium.

The entire manufacturing process, from start to packaged chips takes 6-9 weeks,
but as of 2017 regarding 14/10/7nm it can take up to 12-15 weeks (3-4 months).

** Transistors

basically an on/off switch

It has 4 electron on its outer layer and forms thethrahidrons

Doping - is injecting other elements into silicon to make it conductable

N Doping - injects element with more electrons like 5 so free electrons are
available

P Doping - injecting Phosphorus with 3 electrons so that holes(practicaly
positive charges) are left

Introducing voltage will make electicity flow or stop depending on the source
positionig + and -. This can be simulated with PNP transistor.

When we talk about the size of a transistor we mean the size of the
gate/barrier that passes or blocks the flow of electrons.

When it gets down to a few atoms the effects of quantum mechanics must be
considered. At that scale electrons might start to quantum tunnel through the
barrier, which makes for very unreliable transistor.

That can be initialy avoided by selecting elements with smaller atom radius,
but eventually the challenge is in engeneering a high enough barrier.

One other option is embracing quantum mechanics and using this behaviour to
build possibly quantum computers, which may be very well suited to certain type
of task (like breaking encryption or making it unbreakable).

** Intro
*** Current

The story of current starts with the idea of charges, positive and negative
charge. If they are opposite sign there will be force of attraction between
them, or else repel them.

- +

< + + >

- > < +

We can get charge from copper and copper wires.

Cu 29 (29 protons inside and 29 electrons outside)

The last orbit has just one electron in it and it is easiest to pull away
and have it go participate in conduction (electric current).

e-

Silver has the same kind of electron configuration.

If we hook up a source of voltage (battery) to a copper wire, all the loose
last orbit electron will start moving in the direction of the + source on
the battery and at the end an electron will come out the - side of the
battery and make up the difference.

But how do we measure what is heppaning?

count how many e- are passing through a cut in the wire for a second.

Current is reported as the number of charges per unit time passing through
a boundary.

Current i = charge-/sec

What is the direction of Current?

positive current direction is opposite to the electron flow

negative current direction is the direction of the electron flow

Ben Franklin make the decision that the positive current is the direction
of current (nobody knew anything about electrons back then).

Note:
Electron is discovered by J.J.Thompson in 1897

Conventional Current is this positive direction current.

*** Voltage

Intuition:

As idea it is very similar to Gravity.

If you have a large body of mass on the slopes of a mountain, the potential
energy it has is going to be dissipated as kinetic energy and it is going to
roll down the hill.

We can think as voltage being a moutain top and battery delivering e- to the
top and if you release it it goes through all kinds of capacitors, resistors
etc. to the + bottom. High mountain high voltage.

We disign circuits by putting stuff in the way of the electron current

** Circuit Analysis
*** Ideal Circuit Elemements

Resistor R

v = i * R, also known as Ohm's Law

Capacitor C

i = C dv/dt
C is proportionality canstant

Inductor L

v = L di/dt 
L proportionality constant is the inductance of the inductor,
time rate of change of current flowing through the inductor
