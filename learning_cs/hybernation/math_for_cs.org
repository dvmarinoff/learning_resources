## Mathematical Data Types

### Sets

Informally, a set is a bunch of objects, known as elements, that can be just
about anything: numbers, points in space, other sets. Order of elements is not
significant. Elements are unique.

$$ A = { red, blue, green } $$ 
$$ B = { {a,b}, {a,c}, {b,c} } $$ 

For larger or infinite sets:

$$ D ::= {1,2,4,8,16,...}  \text{ the powers of 2 } $$

$$ e \in S $$

asserts that e is an element of set S.

- Some popular sets are:

$$ \emptyset \text{ the empty set } $$
$$ \N \text{ nonnegative integers } $$
$$ \Z \text{ integers } $$
$$ \Q \text{ rational numbers } $$
$$ \R \text{ real numbers } $$
$$ \C \text{ complex numbers } $$

- Comparing sets:

$$ S \subseteq T $$

S is a subset of T and and every element of S is also in T.
Think of the symbol $ \subseteq  $ as rounded $ \leq $.

$$ S \subset T $$

S is strict subset of T - they are not equal.

- Operations:

Union of sets A and B, denoted $ A \cup B $:

$$ x \in A \cup B \text{ iff } x \in A \text{ OR } x \in B $$

Intersection of A and B, denoted A \cap B:

$$ x \in B \text{ iff } x \in A \text{ AND } x \in B $$

Set difference of A and B, denoted A - B:

$$ x \in A - B \text{ iff } x \in A \text{ AND } x \notin B $$

### Sequences

### Functions

A function assaigns an element of one set, called the domain, to an element of
another set, called the codomain:

$$ f : A \to B  $$

$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{x^{2}} $$

$$ f(P, Q) = [P \text{ IMPLIES } Q]  $$
