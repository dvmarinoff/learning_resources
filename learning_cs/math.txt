1. Wiki
    - from greek trigonon (triangle) and metron measure
    - a branch of math that studies relationships involving lengths and angles of triangles
    - emerged in the Hellenistic world during 3rd c. B.C. from applications of geometry to astonomical studies
    - if at least the length of one side and the value of one angle is known all can be determined
    - since any non-right-angle-triangle(on a flat plane) can be bisected to create two right-angle triangles,
    most problems can be reduced to calculations on right-angle triangles. One exception is spherical trigonometry

    Sine = Opposite / Hypotenuse     - SOH
    Cosine = Adjecent / Hypotenuse   - CAH
    Tangent = Opposite / Adjecent    - TOA
