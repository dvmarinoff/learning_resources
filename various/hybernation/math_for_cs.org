## Mathematical Data Types

### Sets

Informally, a set is a bunch of objects, known as elements, that can be just
about anything: numbers, points in space, other sets. Order of elements is not
significant. Elements are unique.

$$ A = { red, blue, green } $$ 
$$ B = { {a,b}, {a,c}, {b,c} } $$ 

For larger or infinite sets:

$$ D ::= {1,2,4,8,16,...}  \text{ the powers of 2 } $$

$$ e \in S $$

asserts that e is an element of set S.

- Some popular sets are:

$$ \emptyset \text{ the empty set } $$
$$ \N \text{ nonnegative integers } $$
$$ \Z \text{ integers } $$
$$ \Q \text{ rational numbers } $$
$$ \R \text{ real numbers } $$
$$ \C \text{ complex numbers } $$

- Comparing sets:

$$ S \subseteq T $$

S is a subset of T and and every element of S is also in T.
Think of the symbol $ \subseteq  $ as rounded $ \leq $.

$$ S \subset T $$

S is strict subset of T - they are not equal.

- Operations:

Union of sets A and B, denoted $ A \cup B $:

$$ x \in A \cup B \text{ iff } x \in A \text{ OR } x \in B $$

Intersection of A and B, denoted A \cap B:

$$ x \in B \text{ iff } x \in A \text{ AND } x \in B $$

Set difference of A and B, denoted A - B:

$$ x \in A - B \text{ iff } x \in A \text{ AND } x \notin B $$

### Sequences

### Functions

A function assaigns an element of one set, called the domain, to an element of
another set, called the codomain:

$$ f : A \to B  $$

$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{x^{2}} $$

$$ f(P, Q) = [P \text{ IMPLIES } Q]  $$




## Number Theory

study of the integers: 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
It is widely used in cryptography (the study and practice of hiding numbers).

# Graph Theory

Def: A graph G is a pair of sets (V, E) where
V is a nonempty set of items called vertices or nodes and
E is a set of 2 item subsets of V called edges.

graphs with no vertices are not allowed
graphs with no edges are ok

Def: two nodes $ x_{i}, x_{j} $ are adjacent if $ { x_{i}, x_{j} } \in E $
(meaning they are connected by edge).

Def: An edge $ e = { x_{i}, x_{j} } $ is incident to its end points $ x_{i},
x_{j} $.

Def: The number of edges incident to a node is called the degree of the node.

deg(x_{5}) = 3

Def: A graph is simple if it has no loops or multiple edges.
Loop is an edge that connects a node only to itself.
Multiedge is we have 2 edges that are the same, they connect the same
endpoints.



Case 1: Opposite gender partners
74% Univercity of Chicago
233% ABC News

Nodes are men and women, edges are partners

Men   | * * * *
Women | * * * *

V     ~ 300
V_{m} ~ 147.5
V_{w} ~ 152.4
E     = ?

Def:
A_{m} = average number of opposite gender partners for men
A_{w} = average number of opposite gender partners for women

What is A_{m} / A_{w}?

A_{m} = sum of the degrees divided by the number of nodes
      = cardinality of the Edges over cardinality of the set of all men

$ A_{m} = frac{\sum^{k \in V_{m}} deg(x)}{V_{m}} = \frac{\nmid E
\nmid}{\nmid V_{m} \nmid} $

$ \frac{A_{m}}{A_{w}} = \frac{ \frac{\nmid E \nmid}{ \nmid V_{m} \nmid }
}{\frac{\nmid E \nmid}{ \nmid V_{w} \nmid }} = \frac{\nmid V_{m} \nmid}{\nmid
V_{w} \nmid} = 1.0325 = 3.25% $

Def: Graph Coloring Problem: Given a graph G and K colors assign color to each
node so adjacent nodes get different colors.

Def: The minimum number of colors that you need is called the chromatic  number
of the graph. It's an NP-complete problem. Needs exponential time to check.

Basic Graph Coloring Algorithm: for graph G (V, E)
1. order the nodes from V_{1} to V_{n}
2. order the colors from C_{1} to C_{m}
3. process the nodes one at a time
for i=1...n
    Assign the lowest legal color to V_{i}

Different orderings of the nodes results in different number of colors used.
If you start from largest degrees you may use less colors.
This is an exmple of Greedy Algorithm. You do the best you can at each step.

Thm: If every node in a graph G has degree <= d, then
Basic Graph coloring uses at most d + 1 colors for G.

Proof: By Induction

1. Induction hypothesis: P(n)

2. Base case: n = 1 -> 0 edges, d = 0, 1 color = d + 1

3. Inductive step:
Assume P(n) i s true for the induction.
Let G = (V,E) be any n + 1 node graph.
Let d = max degree in G.

Order the nodes V_{1}, V_{2}, \dots, V_{n}, V_{n + 1}

## Sums and Asymptotics

Summary:
Collection of rules and methods for fincding closed form expresions for
commonly-occuring sums and product and asymptotics which is used to express
how a quantity such as running time grow with the size of input.

$ 1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} $

The left-hand side expressed concisly is:

$ \sum_{i=1}^{n} i $,

but the right-hand size is not on;y concise, but also easier to evaluate.
It reveals properties such as the growth rate of the sum. Such expressions are
called closed forms.

$ 1+x+x^{2}+x^{3} \dots + x^n = \frac{1 - x^{n+1}}{1 - x} $

is another example with a geometric sum

Methods for sums work with products, since any product can be converted into a
sum by taking its logarithm.
